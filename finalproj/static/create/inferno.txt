canto i 


in middle of the journey of our days 
i found that i was in a darksome wood 
the right road lost and vanished in the maze 
ah me how hard to make it understood 
how rough that wood was wild and terrible 
by the mere thought my terror is renewed 
more bitter scarce were death but ere i tell 
at large of good which there by me was found 
i will relate what other things befell 
scarce know i how i entered on that ground 
so deeply at the moment when i passed 
from the right way was i in slumber drowned 
but when beneath a hill arrived at last 
which for the boundary of the valley stood 
that with such terror had my heart harassed 
i upwards looked and saw its shoulders glowed 
radiant already with that planets light 
which guideth surely upon every road 
a little then was quieted by the sight 
the fear which deep within my heart had lain 
through all my sore experience of the night 
and as the man who breathing short in pain 
hath scaped the sea and struggled to the shore 
turns back to gaze upon the perilous main 
even so my soul which fear still forward bore 
turned to review the pass whence i egressed 
and which none living ever left before 
my wearied frame refreshed with scanty rest 
i to ascend the lonely hill essayed 
the lower foot still that on which i pressed 
and lo ere i had well beginning made 
a nimble leopard light upon her feet 
and in a skin all spotted oer arrayed 
nor ceased she eer me full in the face to meet 
and to me in my path such hindrance threw 
that many a time i wheeled me to retreat 
it was the hour of dawn with retinue 
of stars that were with him when love divine 
in the beginning into motion drew 
those beauteous things the sun began to shine 
and i took heart to be of better cheer 
touching the creature with the gaudy skin 
seeing twas morn and springtide of the year 
yet not so much but that when into sight 
a lion came i was disturbed with fear 
towards me he seemed advancing in his might 
rabid with hunger and with head high thrown 
the very air was tremulous with fright 
a shewolf too beheld i further on 
all kinds of lust seemed in her leanness pent 
through her ere now much folk have misery known 
by her oppressed and altogether spent 
by the terror breathing from her aspect fell 
i lost all hope of making the ascent 
and as the man who joys while thriving well 
when comes the time to lose what he has won 
in all his thoughts weeps inconsolable 
so mourned i through the brute which rest knows none 
she barred my way again and yet again 
and thrust me back where silent is the sun 
and as i downward rushed to reach the plain 
before mine eyes appeared there one aghast 
and dumb like those that silence long maintain 
when i beheld him in the desert vast 
whateer thou art or ghost or man i cried 
i pray thee show such pity as thou hast 
no man though once i was on either side 
lombard my parents were and both of them 
for native place had mantua he replied 
though late sub julio to the world i came 
and lived at rome in good augustus day 
while yet false gods and lying were supreme 
poet i was renowning in my lay 
anchises righteous son who fled from troy 
what time proud ilion was to flames a prey 
but thou why going back to such annoy 
the hill delectable why fear to mount 
the origin and ground of every joy 
and thou in sooth art virgil and the fount 
whence in a stream so full doth language flow 
abashed i answered him with humble front 
of other poets light and honour thou 
let the long study and great zeal ive shown 
in searching well thy book avail me now 
my master thou and author thou alone 
from thee alone i borrowing could attain 
the style consummate which has made me known 
behold the beast which makes me turn again 
deliver me from her illustrious sage 
because of her i tremble pulse and vein 
thou must attempt another pilgrimage 
observing that i wept he made reply 
if from this waste thyself thou dst disengage 
because the beast thou art afflicted by 
will suffer none along her way to pass 
but hindering them harasses till they die 
so vile a nature and corrupt she has 
her raging lust is still insatiate 
and food but makes it fiercer than it was 
many a creature hath she taen for mate 
and more shell wed until the hound comes forth 
to slay her and afflict with torment great 
he will not batten upon pelf or earth 
but he shall feed on valour love and lore 
feltro and feltro tween shall be his birth 
he will save humbled italy and restore 
for which of old virgin camilla died 
turnus euryalus nisus died of yore 
her through all cities chasing far and wide 
he at the last to hell will thrust her down 
whence envy first unloosed her i decide 
therefore and judge that thou hadst best come on 
with me for guide and hence ill lead thee where 
a place eternal shall to thee be shown 
there shalt thou hear the howlings of despair 
in which the ancient spirits make lament 
all of them fain the second death to share 
next shalt thou them behold who are content 
because they hope some time though now in fire 
to join the blessed they will win consent 
and if to these thou later wouldst aspire 
a soul shall guide thee worthier far than i 
when i depart thee will i leave with her 
because the emperor who reigns on high 
wills not since gainst his laws i did rebel 
that to his city i bring any nigh 
oer all the world he rules there reigns as well 
there is his city and exalted seat 
o happy whom he chooses there to dwell 
and i to him poet i thee entreat 
even by that god who was to thee unknown 
that i may scape this present ill nor meet 
with worse conduct me whither thou hast shown 
that i may see saint peters gate and those 
whom thou reportest in such misery thrown 
he moved away behind him held i close 


canto ii 


it was the close of day the twilight brown 
all living things on earth was setting free 
from toil while i preparing was alone 
to face the battle which awaited me 
as well of ruth as of the perilous quest 
now to be limned by faultless memory 
help lofty genius muses manifest 
goodwill to me recording what befell 
do thou o mind now show thee at thy best 
i thus began poet and guide as well 
ere trusting me on this adventure wide 
judge if my strength of it be capable 
thou sayst that silvius father ere he died 
still mortal to the world immortal went 
there in the body some time to abide 
yet that the foe of evil was content 
that he should come seeing what high effect 
and who and what should from him claim descent 
no room for doubt can thoughtful man detect 
for he of noble rome and of her sway 
imperial in high heaven grew sire elect 
and both of these the very truth to say 
were founded for the holy seat whereon 
the greater peters follower sits today 
upon this journey praised by thee were known 
and heard things by him to the which he owed 
his triumph whence derives the papal gown 
that path the chosen vessel later trod 
so of the faith assurance to receive 
which is beginning of salvations road 
but why should i go who will sanction give 
for i am no æneas and no paul 
me worthy of it no one can believe 
nor i myself hence venturing at thy call 
i dread the journey may prove rash but vain 
for me to reason wise thou knowst it all 
like one no more for what he wished for fain 
whose purpose shares mutation with his thought 
till from the thing begun he turns again 
on that dim slope so grew i all distraught 
because by brooding on it the design 
i shrank from which before i warmly sought 
if well i understand these words of thine 
the shade of him magnanimous made reply 
thy soul neath cowardice hath sunk supine 
which a man often is so burdened by 
it makes him falter from a noble aim 
as beasts at objects illdistinguished shy 
to loose thee from this terror why i came 
and what the speech i heard i will relate 
when first of all i pitied thee a dame 
hailed me where i mongst those in dubious state 
had my abode so blest was she and fair 
her to command me i petitioned straight 
her eyes were shining brighter than the star 
and she began to say in accents sweet 
and tuneable as angels voices are 
o mantuan shade in courtesy complete 
whose fame survives on earth nor less shall grow 
through all the ages while the world hath seat 
a friend of mine with fortune for his foe 
has met with hindrance on his desert way 
and terrorsmitten can no further go 
but turns and that he is too far astray 
and that i rose too late for help i dread 
from what in heaven concerning him they say 
go with thy speech persuasive him bestead 
and with all needful help his guardian prove 
that touching him i may be comforted 
know it is beatrice seeks thee thus to move 
thence come i where i to return am fain 
my coming and my plea are ruled by love 
when i shall stand before my lord again 
often to him i will renew thy praise 
and here she ceased nor did i dumb remain 
o virtuous lady thou alone the race 
of man exaltest bove all else that dwell 
beneath the heaven which wheels in narrowest space 
to do thy bidding pleases me so well 
though twere already done twere all too slow 
thy wish at greater length no need to tell 
but say what tempted thee to come thus low 
even to this centre from the region vast 
whither again thou art on fire to go 
this much to learn since a desire thou hast 
she answered briefly thee ill satisfy 
how coming here i through no terrors passed 
we are of right such things alarmèd by 
as have the power to hurt us all beside 
are harmless and not fearful wherefore i 
thus formed by god his bounty is so wide 
am left untouched by all your miseries 
and through this burning unmolested glide 
a noble lady is in heaven who sighs 
oer the obstruction where id have thee go 
and breaks the rigid edict of the skies 
calling on lucia thus she made her know 
what she desired thy vassal now hath need 
of help from thee do thou then helpful show 
lucia who hates all cruelty in speed 
rose and approaching where i sat at rest 
to venerable rachel giving heed 
me beatrice true praise of god addressed 
why not help him who had such love for thee 
and from the vulgar throng to win thee pressed 
dost thou not hear him weeping pitiably 
nor mark the death now threatening him upon 
a flood than which less awful is the sea 
never on earth did any ever run 
allured by profit or impelled by fear 
swifter than i when speaking she had done 
from sitting mong the blest descended here 
my trust upon thy comely rhetoric cast 
which honours thee and those who lend it ear 
when of these words she spoken had the last 
she turned aside bright eyes which tears did fill 
and i by this was urged to greater haste 
and so it was i joined thee by her will 
and from that raging beast delivered thee 
which barred the near way up the beauteous hill 
what ails thee then why thus a laggard be 
why cherish in thy heart a craven fear 
where is thy franchise where thy bravery 
when three such blessed ladies have a care 
for thee in heavens court and these words of mine 
thee for such wealth of blessedness prepare 
as flowers by chills nocturnal made to pine 
and shut themselves when touched by morning bright 
upon their stems arise fullblown and fine 
so of my faltering courage changed the plight 
and such good cheer ran through my heart it spurred 
me to declare like freeborn generous wight 
o pitiful who for my succour stirred 
and thou how full of courtesy to run 
alert in service hearkening her true word 
thou with thine eloquence my heart hast won 
to keen desire to go and the intent 
which first i held i now no longer shun 
therefore proceed my will with thine is blent 
thou art my guide lord master thou alone 
thus i and with him as he forward went 
the steep and rugged road i entered on 


canto iii 


through me to the city dolorous lies the way 
who pass through me shall pains eternal prove 
through me are reached the people lost for aye 
twas justice did my glorious maker move 
i was created by the power divine 
the highest wisdom and the primal love 
no things creation earlier was than mine 
if not eternal i for aye endure 
ye who make entrance every hope resign 
these words beheld i writ in hue obscure 
on summit of a gateway wherefore i 
hard is their meaning master like one sure 
beforehand of my thought he made reply 
here it behoves to leave all fears behind 
all cowardice behoveth here to die 
for now the place i told thee of we find 
where thou the miserable folk shouldst see 
who the true good of reason have resigned 
then with a glance of glad serenity 
he took my hand in his which made me bold 
and brought me in where secret things there be 
there sighs and plaints and wailings uncontrolled 
the dim and starless air resounded through 
nor at the first could i from tears withhold 
the various languages and words of woe 
the uncouth accents mixed with angry cries 
and smiting palms and voices loud and low 
composed a tumult which doth circling rise 
for ever in that air obscured for aye 
as when the sand upon the whirlwind flies 
and horrorstricken i began to say 
master what sound can this be that i hear 
and who the folk thus whelmed in misery 
and he replied in this condition drear 
are held the souls of that inglorious crew 
who lived unhonoured but from guilt kept clear 
mingled they are with caitiff angels who 
though from avowed rebellion they refrained 
disloyal to god did selfish ends pursue 
heaven hurled them forth lest they her beauty stained 
received they are not by the nether hell 
else triumph thence were by the guilty gained 
and i what bear they master to compel 
their lamentations in such grievous tone 
he answered in few words i will thee tell 
no hope of death is to the wretches known 
so dim the life and abject where they sigh 
they count all sufferings easier than their own 
of them the world endures no memory 
mercy and justice them alike disdain 
speak we not of them glance and pass them by 
i saw a banner when i looked again 
which always whirling round advanced in haste 
as if despising steadfast to remain 
and after it so many people chased 
in long procession i should not have said 
that death had ever wrought such countless waste 
some first i recognised and then the shade 
i saw and knew of him the search to close 
whose dastard soul the great refusal made 
straightway i knew and was assured that those 
were of the tribe of caitiffs even the race 
despised of god and hated of his foes 
the wretches who when living showed no trace 
of life went naked and were fiercely stung 
by wasps and hornets swarming in that place 
blood drawn by these out of their faces sprung 
and mingled with their tears was at their feet 
sucked up by loathsome worms it fell among 
casting mine eyes beyond of these replete 
people i saw beside an ample stream 
whereon i said o master i entreat 
tell who these are and by what law they seem 
impatient till across the river gone 
as i distinguish by this feeble gleam 
and he these things shall unto thee be known 
what time our footsteps shall at rest be found 
upon the woful shores of acheron 
then with ashamèd eyes cast on the ground 
fearing my words were irksome in his ear 
until we reached the stream i made no sound 
and toward us lo within a bark drew near 
a veteran who with ancient hair was white 
shouting ye souls depraved be filled with fear 
hope never more of heaven to win the sight 
i come to take you to the other strand 
to frost and fire and everlasting night 
and thou o living soul who there dost stand 
from mong the dead withdraw thee then aware 
that not at all i stirred at his command 
by other ways from other ports thoult fare 
but they will lead thee to another shore 
and tis a skiff more buoyant must thee bear 
and then my leader charon be not sore 
for thus it has been willed where power neer came 
short of the will thou therefore ask no more 
and hereupon his shaggy cheeks grew tame 
who is the pilot of the livid pool 
and round about whose eyes glowed wheels of flame 
but all the shades naked and spent with dool 
stood chattering with their teeth and changing hue 
soon as they heard the words unmerciful 
god they blasphemed and families whence they grew 
mankind the time place seed in which began 
their lives and seed whence they were born then drew 
they crowding all together as they ran 
bitterly weeping to the accursed shore 
predestinate for every godless man 
the demon charon with eyes evermore 
aglow makes signals gathering them all 
and whoso lingers smiteth with his oar 
and as the faded leaves of autumn fall 
one after the other till at last the bough 
sees on the ground spread all its coronal 
with adams evil seed so haps it now 
at signs each falls in turn from off the coast 
as fowls into the ambush fluttering go 
the gloomy waters thus by them are crossed 
and ere upon the further side they land 
on this anew is gathering a host 
son said the courteous master understand 
all such as in the wrath of god expire 
from every country muster on this strand 
to cross the river they are all on fire 
their wills by heavenly justice goaded on 
until their terror merges in desire 
this way no righteous soul has ever gone 
wherefore of thee if charon should complain 
now art thou sure what by his words is shown 
when he had uttered this the dismal plain 
trembled so violently my terror past 
recalling now im bathed in sweat again 
out of the tearful ground there moaned a blast 
whence lightning flashed forth red and terrible 
which vanquished all my senses and as cast 
in sudden slumber to the ground i fell 







canto iv 


resounding thunder broke the slumber deep 
that drowsed my senses and myself i shook 
like one by force awakened out of sleep 
then rising up i cast a steady look 
with eyes refreshed on all that lay around 
and cognisance of where i found me took 
in sooth me on the valleys brink i found 
of the dolorous abyss where infinite 
despairing cries converge with thundering sound 
cloudy it was and deep and dark as night 
so dark that peering eagerly to find 
what its depths held no object met my sight 
descend we now into this region blind 
began the poet with a face all pale 
i will go first and do thou come behind 
marking the wanness on his cheek prevail 
i asked how can i seeing thou hast dread 
my wonted comforter when doubts assail 
the anguish of the people then he said 
who are below has painted on my face 
pity by thee for fear interpreted 
come the long journey bids us move apace 
then entered he and made me enter too 
the topmost circle girding the abyss 
therein as far as i by listening knew 
there was no lamentation save of sighs 
whence throbbed the air eternal through and through 
this sorrow without suffering made arise 
from infants and from women and from men 
gathered in great and many companies 
and the good master wouldst thou nothing then 
of who those spirits are have me relate 
yet know ere passing further although when 
on earth they sinned not worth however great 
availed them not they being unbaptized 
part of the faith thou holdest if their fate 
was to be born ere man was christianised 
god as behoved they never could adore 
and i myself am with this folk comprised 
for such defectsour guilt is nothing more 
we are thus lost suffering from this alone 
that hopeless we our want of bliss deplore 
greatly i sorrowed when he made this known 
because i knew that some who did excel 
in worthiness were to that limbo gone 
tell me o sir i prayed him master tell 
that i of the belief might surety win 
victorious every error to dispel 
did ever any hence to bliss attain 
by merit of another or his own 
and he to whom my hidden drift was plain 
i to this place but lately had come down 
when i beheld one hither make descent 
a potentate who wore a victors crown 
the shade of our first sire forth with him went 
and his son abels noahs forth he drew 
moses who gave the laws the obedient 
patriarch abrams and king davids too 
and with his sire and children israel 
and rachel winning whom such toils he knew 
and many more in blessedness to dwell 
and i would have thee know earlier than these 
no human soul was ever saved from hell 
while thus he spake our progress did not cease 
but we continued through the wood to stray 
the wood i mean with crowded ghosts for trees 
ere from the summit far upon our way 
we yet had gone i saw a flame which glowed 
holding a hemisphere of dark at bay 
twas still a little further on our road 
yet not so far but that in part i guessed 
that honourable people there abode 
of art and science ornament confessed 
who are these honoured in such high degree 
and in their lot distinguished from the rest 
he said for them their glorious memory 
still in thy world the subject of renown 
wins grace by heaven distinguished thus to be 
meanwhile i heard a voice be honour shown 
to the illustrious poet for his shade 
is now returning which a while was gone 
when the voice paused nor further utterance made 
four mighty shades drew near with one accord 
in aspect neither sorrowful nor glad 
consider that one armèd with a sword 
began my worthy master in my ear 
before the three advancing like their lord 
for he is homer poet with no peer 
horace the satirist is next in line 
ovid comes third and lucan in the rear 
and tis because their claim agrees with mine 
upon the name they with one voice did cry 
they to their honour in my praise combine 
thus i beheld their goodly company 
the lords of song in that exalted style 
which oer all others eaglelike soars high 
having conferred among themselves a while 
they turned toward me and salutation made 
and this beholding did my master smile 
and honour higher still to me was paid 
for of their company they made me one 
so i the sixth part mong such genius played 
thus journeyed we to where the brightness shone 
holding discourse which now tis well to hide 
as where i was to hold it was well done 
at length we reached a noble castles side 
which lofty sevenfold walls encompassed round 
and it was moated by a sparkling tide 
this we traversed as if it were dry ground 
i through seven gates did with those sages go 
then in a verdant mead people we found 
whose glances were deliberate and slow 
authority was stamped on every face 
seldom they spake in tuneful voices low 
we drew apart to a high open space 
upon one side which luminously serene 
did of them all a perfect view embrace 
thence opposite on the enamel green 
were shown me mighty spirits with delight 
i still am stirred them only to have seen 
with many more electra was in sight 
mong them i hector and æneas spied 
cæsar in arms his eyes like falcons bright 
and opposite camilla i descried 
penthesilea too the latian king 
sat with his child lavinia by his side 
brutus i saw who tarquin forth did fling 
cornelia marcia julia and lucrece 
saladin sat alone considering 
what lay beyond with somewhat lifted eyes 
the master i beheld of those that know 
mong such as in philosophy were wise 
all gazed on him as if toward him to show 
becoming honour plato in advance 
with socrates the others stood below 
democritus who set the world on chance 
thales diogenes empedocles 
zeno and anaxagoras met my glance 
heraclitus and dioscorides 
wise judge of nature tully orpheus were 
with ethic seneca and linus these 
and ptolemy too and euclid geometer 
galen hippocrates and avicen 
averroes the same who did prepare 
the comment saw i nor can tell again 
the names of all i saw the subject wide 
so urgent is time often fails me then 
into two bands the six of us divide 
me by another way my leader wise 
doth from the calm to air which trembles guide 
i reach a part which all benighted lies 





canto v 


from the first circle thus i downward went 
into the second which girds narrower space 
but greater woe compelling loud lament 
minos waits awful there and snarls the case 
examining of all who enter in 
and as he girds him dooms them to their place 
i say each illstarred spirit must begin 
on reaching him its guilt in full to tell 
and he omniscient as concerning sin 
sees to what circle it belongs in hell 
then round him is his tail as often curled 
as he would have it stages deep to dwell 
and evermore before him stand a world 
of shades and all in turn to judgment come 
confess and hear and then are downward hurled 
o thou who comest to the very home 
of woe when he beheld me minos cried 
ceasing a while from utterance of doom 
enter not rashly nor in all confide 
by ease of entering be not led astray 
why also growling answered him my guide 
seek not his course predestinate to stay 
for thus tis willed where nothing ever fails 
of what is willed no further speech essay 
and now by me are agonising wails 
distinguished plain now am i come outright 
where grievous lamentation me assails 
now had i reached a place devoid of light 
raging as in a tempest howls the sea 
when with it winds blown thwart each other fight 
the infernal storm is raging ceaselessly 
sweeping the shades along with it and them 
it smites and whirls nor lets them ever be 
arrived at the precipitous extreme 
in shrieks and lamentations they complain 
and even the power divine itself blaspheme 
i understood that to this mode of pain 
are doomed the sinners of the carnal kind 
who oer their reason let their impulse reign 
as starlings in the wintertime combined 
float on the wing in crowded phalanx wide 
so these bad spirits driven by that wind 
float up and down and veer from side to side 
nor for their comfort any hope they spy 
of rest or even of suffering mollified 
and as the cranes in longdrawn company 
pursue their flight while uttering their song 
so i beheld approach with wailing cry 
shades lifted onward by that whirlwind strong 
master what folk are these i therefore said 
who by the murky air are whipped along 
she first of them his answer thus was made 
of whom thou wouldst a wider knowledge win 
oer many tongues and peoples empire swayed 
so ruined was she by licentious sin 
that she decreed lust should be uncontrolled 
to ease the shame that she herself was in 
she is semiramis of whom tis told 
she followed ninus and his wife had been 
hers were the realms now by the sultan ruled 
the next is she who amorous and selfslain 
unto sichæus dust did faithless show 
then lustful cleopatra next was seen 
helen for whom so many years in woe 
ran out and i the great achilles knew 
who at the last encountered love for foe 
paris i saw and tristram in review 
a thousand shades and more he one by one 
pointed and named whom love from life withdrew 
and after i had heard my teacher run 
oer many a dame of yore and many a knight 
i lost in pity was wellnigh undone 
then i o poet if i only might 
speak with the two that as companions hie 
and on the wind appear to be so light 
and he to me when they shall come more nigh 
them shalt thou mark and by the love shalt pray 
which leads them onward and they will comply 
soon as the wind bends them to where we stay 
i lift my voice o wearied souls and worn 
come speak with us if none the boon gainsay 
then even as doves urged by desire return 
on outspread wings and firm to their sweet nest 
as through the air by mere volition borne 
from didos band those spirits issuing pressed 
towards where we were athwart the air malign 
my passionate prayer such influence possessed 
o living creature gracious and benign 
us visiting in this obscurèd air 
who did the earth with blood incarnadine 
if in the favour of the king we were 
who rules the world we for thy peace would pray 
since our misfortunes thy compassion stir 
whateer now pleases thee to hear or say 
we listen to or tell at your demand 
while yet the wind as now doth silent stay 
my native city lies upon the strand 
where to the sea descends the river po 
for peace with all his tributary band 
love in a generous heart set soon aglow 
seized him for the fair form was mine above 
and still it irks me to have lost it so 
love which absolves no one beloved from love 
so strong a passion for him in me wrought 
that as thou seest i still its mastery prove 
love led us where we in one death were caught 
for him who slew us waits caïna now 
unto our ears these words from them were brought 
when i had heard these troubled souls my brow 
i downward bent and long while musing stayed 
until the poet asked what thinkest thou 
and when i answered him alas i said 
sweet thoughts how many and what strong desire 
these to their sad catastrophe betrayed 
then turned once more to them i to inquire 
began francesca these thine agonies 
me with compassion unto tears inspire 
but tell me at the season of sweet sighs 
what sign made love and what the means he chose 
to strip your dubious longings of disguise 
and she to me the bitterest of woes 
is to remember in the midst of pain 
a happy past as well thy teacher knows 
yet none the less and since thou art so fain 
the first occasion of our love to hear 
like one i speak that cannot tears restrain 
as we for pastime one day reading were 
how lancelot by love was fettered fast 
all by ourselves and without any fear 
moved by the tale our eyes we often cast 
on one another and our colour fled 
but one word was it vanquished us at last 
when how the smile long wearied for we read 
was kissed by him who loved like none before 
this one who henceforth never leaves me laid 
a kiss on my mouth trembling the while all oer 
the book was galahad and he as well 
who wrote the book that day we read no more 
and while one shade continued thus to tell 
the other wept so bitterly i swooned 
away for pity and as dead i fell 
yea as a corpse falls fell i on the ground 


canto vi 


when i regained my senses which had fled 
at my compassion for the kindred two 
which for pure sorrow quite had turned my head 
new torments and a crowd of sufferers new 
i see around me as i move again 
whereer i turn whereer i bend my view 
in the third circle am i of the rain 
which heavy cold eternal big with woe 
doth always of one kind and force remain 
large hail and turbid water mixed with snow 
keep pouring down athwart the murky air 
and from the ground they fall on stenches grow 
the savage cerberus a monster drear 
howls from his threefold throat with canine cries 
above the people who are whelmèd there 
oily and black his beard and red his eyes 
his belly huge claws from his fingers sprout 
the shades he flays hooks rends in cruel wise 
beat by the rain these doglike yelp and shout 
and shield themselves in turn with either side 
and oft the wretched sinners turn about 
when we by cerberus great worm were spied 
he oped his mouths and all his fangs he showed 
while not a limb did motionless abide 
my leader having spread his hands abroad 
filled both his fists with earth taen from the ground 
and down the ravening gullets flung the load 
then as sharp set with hunger barks the hound 
but is appeased when at his meat he gnaws 
and worrying it forgets all else around 
so with those filthy faces there it was 
of the fiend cerberus who deafs the crowd 
of souls till they from hearing fain would pause 
we travelling oer the spirits who lay cowed 
and sorely by the grievous showers harassed 
upon their semblances of bodies trod 
prone on the ground the whole of them were cast 
save one of them who sat upright with speed 
when he beheld that near to him we passed 
o thou who art through this inferno led 
me if thou canst he asked me recognise 
for ere i was dismantled thou wast made 
and i to him thy present tortured guise 
perchance hath blurred my memory of thy face 
until it seems i neer on thee set eyes 
but tell me who thou art within this place 
so cruel set exposed to such a pain 
than which if greater none has more disgrace 
and he thy city swelling with the bane 
of envy till the sack is running oer 
me in the life serene did once contain 
as ciacco me your citizens named of yore 
and for the damning sin of gluttony 
i as thou seest am beaten by this shower 
no solitary woful soul am i 
for all of these endure the selfsame doom 
for the same fault here ended his reply 
i answered him o ciacco with such gloom 
thy misery weighs me i to weep am prone 
but if thou canst declare to what shall come 
the citizens of the divided town 
holds it one just man and declare the cause 
why tis of discord such a victim grown 
then he to me after contentious pause 
blood will be spilt the boorish party then 
will chase the others forth with grievous loss 
the former it behoves to fall again 
within three suns the others to ascend 
holpen by him whose wiles ere now are plain 
long time with heads held high theyll make to bend 
the other party under burdens dire 
howeer themselves in tears and rage they spend 
there are two just men at whom none inquire 
envy and pride and avarice even these 
are the three sparks have set all hearts on fire 
with this the tearful sound he made to cease 
and i to him yet would i have thee tell 
and of thy speech do thou the gift increase 
tegghiaio and farinata honourable 
james rusticucci mosca arrigo 
with all the rest so studious to excel 
in good where are they help me this to know 
great hunger for the news hath seizèd me 
delights them heaven or tortures hell below 
he said among the blackest souls they be 
them to the bottom weighs another sin 
shouldst thou so far descend thou mayst them see 
but when the sweet world thou again dost win 
i pray thee bring me among men to mind 
no more i tell nor new reply begin 
then his straightforward eyes askance declined 
he looked at me a moment ere his head 
he bowed then fell flat mong the other blind 
henceforth he waketh not my leader said 
till he shall hear the angels trumpet sound 
ushering the hostile judge by every shade 
its dismal sepulchre shall then be found 
its flesh and ancient form it shall resume 
and list what echoes in eternal round 
so passed we where the shades and rainy spume 
made filthy mixture with steps taken slow 
touching a little on the world to come 
wherefore i said master shall torments grow 
after the awful sentence hath been heard 
or lesser prove and not so fiercely glow 
repair unto thy science was his word 
which tells as things approach a perfect state 
to keener joy or suffering they are stirred 
therefore although this people cursed by fate 
neer find perfection in its full extent 
to it they then shall more approximate 
than now our course we round the circle bent 
still holding speech of which i nothing say 
until we came where down the pathway went 
there found we plutus the great enemy 



canto vii 


pape satan pape satan aleppe 
plutus began in accents rough and hard 
and that mild sage allknowing said to me 
for my encouragement pay no regard 
unto thy fear whatever power he sways 
thy passage down this cliff shall not be barred 
then turning round to that inflamèd face 
he bade accursed wolf at peace remain 
and pent within thee let thy fury blaze 
down to the pit we journey not in vain 
so rule they where by michael in heavens height 
on the adulterous pride was vengeance taen 
then as the bellied sails by wind swelled tight 
suddenly drag whenever snaps the mast 
such falling to the ground the monsters plight 
to the fourth cavern so we downward passed 
winning new reaches of the doleful shore 
where all the vileness of the world is cast 
justice of god which pilest more and more 
pain as i saw and travail manifold 
why will we sin to be thus wasted sore 
as at charybdis waves are forward rolled 
to break on other billows midway met 
the people here a counterdance must hold 
a greater crowd than i had seen as yet 
with piercing yells advanced on either track 
rolling great stones to which their chests were set 
they crashed together and then each turned back 
upon the way he came while shouts arise 
why clutch it so and why to hold it slack 
in the dark circle wheeled they on this wise 
from either hand to the opposing part 
where evermore they raised insulting cries 
thither arrived each turning made fresh start 
through the half circle a new joust to run 
and i stung almost to the very heart 
said o my master wilt thou make it known 
who the folk are were these all clerks who go 
before us on the left with shaven crown 
and he replied all of them squinted so 
in mental vision while in life they were 
they nothing spent by rule and this they show 
and with their yelping voices make appear 
when halfway round the circle they have sped 
and sins opposing them asunder tear 
each wanting thatch of hair upon his head 
was once a clerk or pope or cardinal 
in whom abound the ripest growths of greed 
and i o master surely among all 
of these i ought some few to recognise 
who by such filthy sins were held in thrall 
and he to me vain thoughts within thee rise 
their witless life which made them vile now mocks 
dimming their faces stillall searching eyes 
eternally they meet with hostile shocks 
these rising from the tomb at last shall stand 
with tight clenched fists and those with ruined locks 
squandering or hoarding they the happy land 
have lost and now are marshalled for this fray 
which to describe doth no fine words demand 
know hence my son how fleeting is the play 
of goods at the dispose of fortune thrown 
and which mankind to such fierce strife betray 
not all the gold which is beneath the moon 
could purchase peace nor all that ever was 
to but one soul of these by toil undone 
master i said tell thou ere making pause 
who fortune is of whom thou speakst askance 
who holds all worldly riches in her claws 
o foolish creatures lost in ignorance 
he answer made now see that the reply 
thou store which i concerning her advance 
he who in knowledge is exalted high 
framing all heavens gave such as should them guide 
that so each part might shine to all whereby 
is equal light diffused on every side 
and likewise to one guide and governor 
of worldly splendours did control confide 
that she in turns should different peoples dower 
with this vain good from blood should make it pass 
to blood in spite of human wit hence power 
some races failing other some amass 
according to her absolute decree 
which hidden lurks like serpent in the grass 
vain gainst her foresight yours must ever be 
she makes provision judges holds her reign 
as doth his power supreme each deity 
her permutations can no truce sustain 
necessity compels her to be swift 
so swift they follow who their turn must gain 
and this is she whom they so often lift 
upon the cross who ought to yield her praise 
and blame on her and scorn unjustly shift 
but she is blest nor hears what any says 
with other primal creatures turns her sphere 
jocund and glad rejoicing in her ways 
to greater woe now let us downward steer 
the stars which rose when i began to guide 
are falling now nor may we linger here 
we crossed the circle to the other side 
arriving where a boiling fountain fell 
into a brooklet by its streams supplied 
in depth of hue the flood did perse excel 
and we with this dim stream to lead us on 
descended by a pathway terrible 
a marsh which by the name of styx is known 
fed by this gloomy brook lies at the base 
of threatening cliffs hewn out of cold grey stone 
and i intent on study of the place 
saw people in that ditch mudsmeared in it 
all naked stood with angerclouded face 
nor with their fists alone each fiercely hit 
the other but with feet and chest and head 
and with their teeth to shreds each other bit 
son now behold the worthy master said 
the souls of those whom anger made a prize 
and further i would have thee certified 
that neath the water people utter sighs 
and make the bubbles to the surface come 
as thou mayst see by casting round thine eyes 
fixed in the mud they say we lived in gloom 
in the sweet air made jocund by the day 
nursing within us melancholy fume 
in this black mud we now our gloom display 
this hymn with gurgling throats they strive to sound 
which they in speech unbroken fail to say 
and thus about the loathsome pool we wound 
for a wide arc between the dry and soft 
with eyes on those who gulp the filth turned round 
at last we reached a tower that soared aloft 


canto viii 


i say continuing that long before 
to its foundations we approachèd nigh 
our eyes went travelling to the top of the tower 
for hung out there two flames we could espy 
then at such distance scarce our eyesight made 
it clearly out another gave reply 
and to the sea of knowledge turned i said 
what meaneth this and what reply would yield 
that other light and who have it displayed 
thou shouldst upon the impure watery field 
he said already what approaches know 
but that the fenfog holds it still concealed 
never was arrow yet from sharpdrawn bow 
urged through the air upon a swifter flight 
than what i saw a tiny vessel show 
across the water shooting into sight 
a single pilot served it for a crew 
who shouted art thou come thou guilty sprite 
o phlegyas phlegyas this thy loud halloo 
for once my lord said idle is and vain 
thou hast us only till the mud were through 
and as one cheated inly smarts with pain 
when the deceit wrought on him is betrayed 
his gathering ire could phlegyas scarce contain 
into the bark my leader stepped and made 
me take my place beside him nor a jot 
till i had entered was it downward weighed 
soon as my guide and i were in the boat 
to cleave the flood began the ancient prow 
deeper than tis with others wont to float 
then as the stagnant ditch we glided through 
one smeared with filth in front of me arose 
and said thus coming ere thy period who 
art thou and i as one who forthwith goes 
i come but thou defiled how name they thee 
i am but one who weeps he said with woes 
i answered him with tears and misery 
accursèd soul remain for thou art known 
unto me now all filthy though thou be 
then both his hands were on the vessel thrown 
but him my wary master backward heaved 
saying do thou mong the other dogs be gone 
then to my neck with both his arms he cleaved 
and kissed my face and soul disdainful said 
o blessed she in whom thou wast conceived 
he in the world great haughtiness displayed 
no deeds of worth his memory adorn 
and therefore rages here his sinful shade 
and many are there by whom crowns are worn 
on earth shall wallow here like swine in mire 
leaving behind them names oerwhelmed in scorn 
and i o master i have great desire 
to see him well soused in this filthy tide 
ere from the lake we finally retire 
and he or ever shall have been descried 
the shore by thee thy longing shall be met 
for such a wish were justly gratified 
a little after in such fierce onset 
the miry people down upon him bore 
i praise and bless god for it even yet 
philip argenti at him was the roar 
and then that furious spirit florentine 
turned with his teeth upon himself and tore 
here was he left nor wins more words of mine 
now in my ears a lamentation rung 
whence i to search what lies ahead begin 
and the good master told me son ere long 
we to the city called of dis draw near 
where in great armies cruel burghers throng 
and i already master i appear 
mosques in the valley to distinguish well 
vermilion as if they from furnace were 
fresh come and he fires everlasting dwell 
within them whence appear they glowing hot 
as thou discernest in this lower hell 
we to the moat profound at length were brought 
which girds that city all disconsolate 
the walls around it seemed of iron wrought 
not without fetching first a compass great 
we came to where with angry cry at last 
get out the boatman yelled behold the gate 
more than a thousand who from heaven were cast 
i saw above the gates who furiously 
demanded who ere death on him has passed 
holds through the region of the dead his way 
and my wise master made to them a sign 
that he had something secretly to say 
then ceased they somewhat from their great disdain 
and said come thou but let that one be gone 
who thus presumptuous enters on this reign 
let him retrace his madcap way alone 
if he but can thou meanwhile lingering here 
through such dark regions who hast led him down 
judge reader if i was not filled with fear 
hearing the words of this accursèd threat 
for of return my hopes extinguished were 
beloved guide who more than seven times set 
me in security and safely brought 
through frightful dangers in my progress met 
leave me not thus undone i him besought 
if further progress be to us denied 
let us retreat together tarrying not 
the lord who led me thither then replied 
fear not by one so great has been assigned 
our passage vainly were all hindrance tried 
await me here and let thy fainting mind 
be comforted and with good hope be fed 
not to be left in this low world behind 
thus goes he thus am i abandonèd 
by my sweet father i in doubt remain 
with yes and no contending in my head 
i could not hear what speech he did maintain 
but no long time conferred he in that place 
till to be first all inward raced again 
and then the gates were closed in my lords face 
by these our enemies outside stood he 
then backward turned to me with lingering pace 
with downcast eyes and all the bravery 
stripped from his brows and he exclaimed with sighs 
who dare deny the doleful seats to me 
and then he said although my wrath arise 
fear not for i to victory will pursue 
howeer within they plot the enterprise 
this arrogance of theirs is nothing new 
they showed it once at a less secret door 
which stands unbolted since thou didst it view 
and saw the darkwrit legend which it bore 
thence even now is one who hastens down 
through all the circles guideless to this shore 
and he shall win us entrance to the town 


canto ix 


the hue which cowardice on my face did paint 
when i beheld my guide return again 
put his new colour quicker neath restraint 
like one who listens did he fixed remain 
for far to penetrate the air like night 
and heavy mist the eye was bent in vain 
yet surely we must vanquish in the fight 
thus he unlessbut with such proffered aid 
o how i weary till he come in sight 
well i remarked how he transition made 
covering his opening words with those behind 
which contradicted what at first he said 
nathless his speech with terror charged my mind 
for haply to the word which broken fell 
worse meaning than he purposed i assigned 
down to this bottom of the dismal shell 
comes ever any from the first degree 
where all their pain is stripped of hope to dwell 
to this my question thus responded he 
seldom it haps to any to pursue 
the journey now embarked upon by me 
yet i ere this descended it is true 
beneath a spell of dire erichthos laid 
who could the corpse with soul inform anew 
short while my flesh of me was empty made 
when she required me to oerpass that wall 
from judas circle to abstract a shade 
that is the deepest darkest place of all 
and furthest from the heaven which moves the skies 
i know the way fear nought that can befall 
these fens from which vile exhalations rise 
the doleful city all around invest 
which now we reach not save in angry wise 
of more he spake nought in my mind doth rest 
for with mine eyes my every thought had been 
fixed on the lofty tower with flaming crest 
where in a moment and upright were seen 
three hellish furies all with blood defaced 
and womanlike in members and in mien 
hydras of brilliant green begirt their waist 
snakes and cerastes for their tresses grew 
and these were round their dreadful temples braced 
that they the drudges were full well he knew 
of her who is the queen of endless woes 
and said to me the fierce erynnyes view 
herself upon the left megæra shows 
that is alecto weeping on the right 
tisiphones between here made he close 
each with her nails her breast tore and did smite 
herself with open palms they screamed in tone 
so fierce i to the poet clove for fright 
medusa come that we may make him stone 
all shouted as they downward gazed alack 
theseus escaped us when he ventured down 
keep thine eyes closed and turn to them thy back 
for if the gorgon chance to be displayed 
and thou shouldst look farewell the upward track 
thus spake the master and himself he swayed 
me round about nor put he trust in mine 
but his own hands upon mine eyelids laid 
o ye with judgment gifted to divine 
look closely now and mark what hidden lore 
lies neath the veil of my mysterious line 
across the turbid waters came a roar 
and crash of sound which big with fear arose 
because of it fell trembling either shore 
the fashion of it was as when there blows 
a blast by cross heats made to rage amain 
which smites the forest and without repose 
the shattered branches sweeps in hurricane 
in clouds of dust majestic onward flies 
wild beasts and herdsmen driving oer the plain 
sharpen thy gaze he badeand freed mine eyes 
across the foamflecked immemorial lake 
where sourest vapour most unbroken lies 
and as the frogs before the hostile snake 
together of the water get them clear 
and on the dry ground huddling shelter take 
more than a thousand ruined souls in fear 
beheld i flee from one who dry of feet 
was by the stygian ferry drawing near 
waving his left hand he the vapour beat 
swiftly from fore his face nor seemed he spent 
save with fatigue at having this to meet 
well i opined that he from heaven was sent 
and to my master turned his gesture taught 
i should be dumb and in obeisance bent 
ah me how with disdain appeared he fraught 
he reached the gate which touching with a rod 
he oped with ease for it resisted not 
people despised and banished far from god 
upon the awful threshold then he spoke 
how holds in you such insolence abode 
why kick against that will which never broke 
short of its end if ever it begin 
and often for you fiercer torments woke 
butting gainst fate what can ye hope to win 
your cerberus as is to you well known 
still bears for this a wellpeeled throat and chin 
then by the passage foul he back was gone 
nor spake to us but like a man was he 
by other cares absorbed and driven on 
than that of those who may around him be 
and we confiding in the sacred word 
moved toward the town in all security 
we entered without hindrance and i spurred 
by my desire the character to know 
and style of place such strong defences gird 
entering begin mine eyes around to throw 
and see on every hand a vast champaign 
the teeming seat of torments and of woe 
and as at arles where rhone spreads oer the plain 
or pola hard upon quarnaro sound 
which bathes the boundaries italian 
the sepulchres uneven make the ground 
so here on every side but far more dire 
and grievous was the fashion of them found 
for scattered mid the tombs blazed many a fire 
because of which these with such fervour burned 
no arts which work in iron more require 
all of the lids were lifted i discerned 
by keen laments which from the tombs arose 
that sad and suffering ones were there inurned 
i said o master tell me who are those 
buried within the tombs of whom the sighs 
come to our ears thus eloquent of woes 
and he to me the lords of heresies 
with followers of all sects a greater band 
than thou wouldst think these sepulchres comprise 
to lodge them like to like the tombs are planned 
the sepulchres have more or less of heat 
then passed we turning to the dexter hand 
tween torments and the lofty parapet 



canto x 


and now advance we by a narrow track 
between the torments and the ramparts high 
my master first and i behind his back 
o mighty virtue at whose will am i 
wheeled through these impious circles then i said 
speak and in full my longing satisfy 
the people who within the tombs are laid 
may they be seen the coverings are all thrown 
open nor is there any guard displayed 
and he to me all shall be fastened down 
when hither from jehoshaphat they come 
again in bodies which were once their own 
all here with epicurus find their tomb 
who are his followers and by whom tis held 
that the soul shares the bodys mortal doom 
things here discovered then shall answer yield 
and quickly to thy question asked of me 
as well as to the wish thou hast concealed 
and i good leader if i hide from thee 
my heart it is that i may little say 
nor only now learned i thus dumb to be 
o tuscan who still living makst thy way 
modest of speech through the abode of flame 
be pleased a little in this place to stay 
the accents of thy language thee proclaim 
to be a native of that state renowned 
which i perchance wronged somewhat sudden came 
these words from out a tomb which there was found 
mongst others whereon i compelled by fright 
a little toward my leader shifted ground 
and he turn round what ails thee lo upright 
beginneth farinata to arise 
all of him bove the girdle comes in sight 
on him already had i fixed mine eyes 
towering erect with lifted front and chest 
he seemed inferno greatly to despise 
and toward him i among the tombs was pressed 
by my guides nimble and courageous hand 
while he choose well thy language gave behest 
beneath his tomb when i had taen my stand 
regarding me a moment of what house 
art thou as if in scorn he made demand 
to show myself obedient anxious 
i nothing hid but told my ancestors 
and listening he gently raised his brows 
fiercely to me they proved themselves adverse 
and to my sires and party then he said 
because of which i did them twice disperse 
i answered him and what although they fled 
twice from all quarters they returned with might 
an art not mastered yet by these you led 
beside him then there issued into sight 
another shade uncovered to the chin 
propped on his knees if i surmised aright 
he peered around as if he fain would win 
knowledge if any other was with me 
and then his hope all spent did thus begin 
weeping by dint of genius if it be 
thou visitst this dark prison where my son 
and wherefore not found in thy company 
and i to him i come not here alone 
he waiting yonder guides me but disdain 
of him perchance was by your guido shown 
the words he used and manner of his pain 
revealed his name to me beyond surmise 
hence was i able thus to answer plain 
then cried he and at once upright did rise 
how saidst thouwas breathes he not then the air 
the pleasant light no longer smites his eyes 
when he of hesitation was aware 
displayed by me in forming my reply 
he fell supine no more to reappear 
but the magnanimous at whose bidding i 
had halted there the same expression wore 
nor budged a jot nor turned his neck awry 
and ifresumed he where he paused before 
they be indeed but slow that art to learn 
than this my bed to hear it pains me more 
but ere the fiftieth time anew shall burn 
the ladys face who reigneth here below 
of that sore art thou shalt experience earn 
and as to the sweet world again thoudst go 
tell me why is that people so without 
ruth for my race as all their statutes show 
and i to him the slaughter and the rout 
which made the arbia to run with red 
cause in our fane such prayers to be poured out 
whereon he heaved a sigh and shook his head 
there i was not alone nor to embrace 
that cause was i without good reason led 
but there i was alone when from her place 
all granted florence should be swept away 
twas i defended her with open face 
so may your seed find peace some better day 
i urged him as this knot you shall untie 
in which my judgment doth entangled stay 
if i hear rightly ye it seems descry 
beforehand what time brings and yet ye seem 
neath other laws as touching what is nigh 
like those who see best what is far from them 
we see things said he which afar remain 
thus much enlightened by the guide supreme 
to know them present or approaching vain 
are all our powers and save what they relate 
who hither come of earth no news we gain 
hence mayst thou gather in how dead a state 
shall all our knowledge from that time be thrown 
when of the future shall be closed the gate 
then for my fault as if repentant grown 
i said report to him who fell supine 
that still among the living breathes his son 
and if i dumb seemed answer to decline 
tell him it was that i upon the knot 
was pondering then you helped me to untwine 
me now my master called whence i besought 
with more than former sharpness of the shade 
to tell me what companions he had got 
he answered me some thousand here are laid 
with me mong these the second frederick 
the cardinal too of others nought be said 
then was he hid and towards the bard antique 
i turned my steps revolving in my brain 
the ominous words which i had heard him speak 
he moved and as we onward went again 
demanded of me wherefore thus amazed 
and to his question i made answer plain 
within thy mind let there be surely placed 
the sage bade what gainst thee thou heardest say 
now mark me well his finger here he raised 
when thou shalt stand within her gentle ray 
whose beauteous eye sees all she will make known 
the stages of thy journey on lifes way 
turning his feet he to the left moved on 
leaving the wall we to the middle went 
upon a path that to a vale strikes down 
which even to us above its foulness sent 



canto xi 


we at the margin of a lofty steep 
made of great shattered stones in circle bent 
arrived where worser torments crowd the deep 
so horrible a stench and violent 
was upward wafted from the vast abyss 
behind the cover we for shelter went 
of a great tomb where i saw written this 
pope anastasius is within me thrust 
whom the straight way photinus made to miss 
now on our course a while we linger must 
the master said be but our sense resigned 
a little to it and the filthy gust 
we shall not heed then i do thou but find 
some compensation lest our time should run 
wasted and he behold twas in my mind 
girt by the rocks before us o my son 
lie three small circles he began to tell 
graded like those with which thou now hast done 
all of them filled with spirits miserable 
that sight of them may thee henceforth suffice 
hear how and wherefore in these groups they dwell 
whateer in heavens abhorred as wickedness 
has injury for its end in others bane 
by fraud resulting or in violent wise 
since fraud to man alone doth appertain 
god hates it most and hence the fraudulent band 
set lowest down endure a fiercer pain 
of the violent is the circle next at hand 
to us and since three ways is violence shown 
tis in three several circuits built and planned 
to god ourselves or neighbours may be done 
violence or on the things by them possessed 
as reasoning clear shall unto thee make known 
our neighbour may by violence be distressed 
with grievous wounds or slain his goods and lands 
by havoc fire and plunder be oppressed 
hence those who wound and slay with violent hands 
robbers and spoilers in the nearest round 
are all tormented in their various bands 
violent against himself may man be found 
and gainst his goods therefore without avail 
they in the next are in repentance drowned 
who on themselves loss of your world entail 
who gamble and their substance madly spend 
and who when called to joy lament and wail 
and even to god may violence extend 
by heart denial and by blasphemy 
scorning what nature doth in bounty lend 
sodom and cahors hence are doomed to lie 
within the narrowest circlet surely sealed 
and such as god within their hearts defy 
fraud gainst whose bite no conscience findeth shield 
a man may use with one who in him lays 
trust or with those who no such credence yield 
beneath this latter kind of it decays 
the bond of love which out of nature grew 
hence in the second circle herd the race 
to feigning given and flattery who pursue 
magic false coining theft and simony 
pimps barrators and suchlike residue 
the other form of fraud makes nullity 
of natural bonds and what is more than those 
the special trust whence men on men rely 
hence in the place whereon all things repose 
the narrowest circle and the seat of dis 
each traitors gulfed in everlasting woes 
thy explanation master as to this 
is clear i said and thou hast plainly told 
who are the people stowed in the abyss 
but tell why those the muddy marshes hold 
the tempestdriven those beaten by the rain 
and such as meeting virulently scold 
are not within the crimson city taen 
for punishment if hateful unto god 
and if not hateful wherefore doomed to pain 
and he to me why wander thus abroad 
more than is wont thy wits or how engrossed 
is now thy mind and on what things bestowed 
hast thou the memory of the passage lost 
in which thy ethics for their subject treat 
of the three moods by heaven abhorred the most 
malice and bestiality complete 
and how compared with these incontinence 
offends god less and lesser blame doth meet 
if of this doctrine thou extract the sense 
and call to memory what people are 
above outside in endless penitence 
why from these guilty they are sundered far 
thou shalt discern and why on them alight 
the strokes of justice in less angry war 
o sun that clearest every troubled sight 
so charmed am i by thy resolving speech 
doubt yields me joy no less than knowing right 
therefore i pray a little backward reach 
i asked to where thou sayst that usury 
sins gainst gods bounty and this mystery teach 
he said who gives ear to philosophy 
is taught by her nor in one place alone 
what nature in her course is governed by 
even mind divine and art which thence hath grown 
and if thy physics thou wilt search within 
thoult find ere many leaves are open thrown 
this art by yours far as your art can win 
is followed closethe teacher by the taught 
as grandchild then to god your art is kin 
and from these twodo thou recall to thought 
how genesis beginsshould come supplies 
of food for man and other wealth be sought 
and since another plan the usurer plies 
nature and natures child have his disdain 
because on other ground his hope relies 
but come for to advance i now am fain 
the fishes over the horizon line 
quiver oer caurus now stands all the wain 
and further yonder does the cliff decline 


canto xii 


the place of our descent before us lay 
precipitous and there was something more 
from sight of which all eyes had turned away 
as at the ruin which upon the shore 
of adige fell upon this side of trent 
through earthquake or by slip of what before 
upheld itfrom the summit whence it went 
far as the plain the shattered rocks supply 
some sort of foothold to who makes descent 
such was the passage down the precipice high 
and on the riven gullys very brow 
lay spread at large the cretan infamy 
which was conceived in the pretended cow 
us when he saw he bit himself for rage 
like one whose anger gnaws him through and through 
perhaps thou deemest called to him the sage 
this is the duke of athens drawing nigh 
who war to the death with thee on earth did wage 
begone thou brute for this one passing by 
untutored by thy sister has thee found 
and only comes thy sufferings to spy 
and as the bull which snaps what held it bound 
on being smitten by the fatal blow 
halts in its course and reels upon the ground 
the minotaur i saw reel to and fro 
and he the alert cried to the passage haste 
while yet he chafes twere well thou down shouldst go 
so we descended by the slippery waste 
of shivered stones which many a time gave way 
neath the new weight my feet upon them placed 
i musing went and he began to say 
perchance this ruined slope thou thinkest on 
watched by the brute rage i did now allay 
but i would have thee know when i came down 
the former time into this lower hell 
the cliff had not this ruin undergone 
it was not long if i distinguish well 
ere he appeared who wrenched great prey from dis 
from out the upmost circle trembling fell 
through all its parts the nauseous abyss 
with such a violence the world i thought 
was stirred by love for as they say by this 
she back to chaos has been often brought 
and then it was this ancient rampart strong 
was shattered here and at another spot 
but toward the valley look we come ere long 
down to the river of blood where boiling lie 
all who by violence work others wrong 
o insane rage o blind cupidity 
by which in our brief life we are so spurred 
ere downward plunged in evil case for aye 
an ample ditch i now beheld engird 
and sweep in circle all around the plain 
as from my escort i had lately heard 
between this and the rock in single train 
centaurs were running who were armed with bows 
as if they hunted on the earth again 
observing us descend they all stood close 
save three of them who parted from the band 
with bow and arrows they in coming chose 
what torment from afar one made demand 
come ye to share who now descend the hill 
i shoot unless ye answer whence ye stand 
my master said we yield no answer till 
we come to chiron standing at thy side 
but thy quick temper always served thee ill 
then touching me tis nessus he who died 
with love for beauteous dejanire possessed 
and who himself his own vendetta plied 
he in the middle staring on his breast 
is mighty chiron who achilles bred 
and next the wrathful pholus they invest 
the fosse and in their thousands round it tread 
shooting whoever from the blood shall lift 
more than his crime allows his guilty head 
as we moved nearer to those creatures swift 
chiron drew forth a shaft and dressed his beard 
back on his jaws using the arrows cleft 
and when his ample mouth of hair was cleared 
he said to his companions have ye seen 
the things the second touches straight are stirred 
as they by feet of shades could neer have been 
and my good guide who to his breast had gone 
the part where join the natures well i ween 
he lives made answer and if thus alone 
he seeks the valley dim neath my control 
necessity not pleasure leads him on 
one came from where the alleluiahs roll 
who charged me with this office strange and new 
no robber he nor mine a felon soul 
but by that power which makes me to pursue 
the rugged journey whereupon i fare 
accord us one of thine to keep in view 
that he may show where lies the ford and bear 
this other on his back to yonder strand 
no spirit he that he should cleave the air 
wheeled to the right then chiron gave command 
to nessus turn and lead them and take tent 
they be not touched by any other band 
we with our trusty escort forward went 
threading the margin of the boiling blood 
where they who seethed were raising loud lament 
people i saw up to the chin imbrued 
these all are tyrants the great centaur said 
who blood and plunder for their trade pursued 
here for their pitiless deeds tears now are shed 
by alexander and dionysius fell 
through whom in sicily dolorous years were led 
the forehead with black hair so terrible 
is ezzelino that one blond of hue 
obizzo deste whom as rumours tell 
his stepson murdered and report speaks true 
i to the poet turned who gave command 
regard thou chiefly him i follow you 
ere long the centaur halted on the strand 
close to a people who far as the throat 
forth of that bulicamë seemed to stand 
thence a lone shade to us he pointed out 
saying in gods house ran he weapon through 
the heart which still on thames wins cult devout 
then i saw people some with heads in view 
and some their chests above the river bore 
and many of them i beholding knew 
and thus the blood went dwindling more and more 
until at last it covered but the feet 
here took we passage to the other shore 
as on this hand thou seest still abate 
in depth the volume of the boiling stream 
the centaur said so grows its depth more great 
believe me towards the opposite extreme 
until again its circling course attains 
the place where tyrants must lament supreme 
justice upon that side involves in pains 
with attila once of the world the pest 
pyrrhus and sextus and for ever drains 
tears out of rinier of corneto pressed 
and rinier pazzo in that boiling mass 
whose brigandage did so the roads infest 
then turned he back alone the ford to pass 



canto xiii 


ere nessus landed on the other shore 
we for our part within a forest drew 
which of no pathway any traces bore 
not green the foliage but of dusky hue 
not smooth the boughs but gnarled and twisted round 
for apples poisonous thorns upon them grew 
no rougher brakes or matted worse are found 
where savage beasts betwixt corneto roam 
and cecina abhorring cultured ground 
the loathsome harpies nestle here at home 
who from the strophades the trojans chased 
with dire predictions of a woe to come 
great winged are they but human necked and faced 
with feathered belly and with claw for toe 
they shriek upon the bushes wild and waste 
ere passing further i would have thee know 
the worthy master thus began to say 
thourt in the second round nor hence shalt go 
till by the horrid sand thy footsteps stay 
give then good heed and things thoult recognise 
that of my words will prove the verity 
wailings on every side i heard arise 
of who might raise them i distinguished nought 
whereon i halted smitten with surprise 
i think he thought that haply twas my thought 
the voices came from people mong the trees 
who to escape us hidingplaces sought 
wherefore the master said from one of these 
snap thou a twig and thou shalt understand 
how little with thy thought the fact agrees 
thereon a little i stretched forth my hand 
and plucked a tiny branch from a great thorn 
why dost thou tear me made the trunk demand 
when dark with blood it had begun to turn 
it cried a second time why wound me thus 
doth not a spark of pity in thee burn 
though trees we be once men were all of us 
yet had our souls the souls of serpents been 
thy hand might well have proved more piteous 
as when the fire hath seized a fagot green 
at one extremity the other sighs 
and wind escaping hisses so was seen 
at where the branch was broken blood to rise 
and words were mixed with it i dropped the spray 
and stood like one whom terror doth surprise 
the sage replied soul vexed with injury 
had he been only able to give trust 
to what he read narrated in my lay 
his hand toward thee would never have been thrust 
tis hard for faith and i to make it plain 
urged him to trial mourn it though i must 
but tell him who thou wast so shall remain 
this for amends to thee thy fame shall blow 
afresh on earth where he returns again 
and then the trunk thy sweet words charm me so 
i cannot dumb remain nor count it hard 
if i some pains upon my speech bestow 
for i am he who held both keys in ward 
of fredericks heart and turned them how i would 
and softly oped it and as softly barred 
till scarce another in his counsel stood 
to my high office i such loyalty bore 
it cost me sleep and haleness of my blood 
the harlot who removeth nevermore 
from cæsars house eyes ignorant of shame 
a common curse of courts the special sore 
set against me the minds of all aflame 
and these in turn augustus set on fire 
till my glad honours bitter woes became 
my soul filled full with a disdainful ire 
thinking by means of death disdain to flee 
gainst my just self unjustly did conspire 
i swear even by the new roots of this tree 
my fealty to my lord i never broke 
for worthy of all honour sure was he 
if one of you return mong living folk 
let him restore my memory overthrown 
and suffering yet because of envys stroke 
still for a while the poet listened on 
then said now he is dumb lose not the hour 
but make request if more thoudst have made known 
and i replied do thou inquire once more 
of what thou thinkest i would gladly know 
i cannot ask ruth wrings me to the core 
on this he spake even as the man shall do 
and liberally what thou of him hast prayed 
imprisoned spirit do thou further show 
how with these knots the spirits have been made 
incorporate and if thou canst declare 
if from such members eer is loosed a shade 
then from the trunk came vehement puffs of air 
next to these words converted was the wind 
my answer to you shall be short and clear 
when the fierce soul no longer is confined 
in flesh torn thence by action of its own 
to the seventh depth by minos tis consigned 
no choice is made of where it shall be thrown 
within the wood but where by chance tis flung 
it germinates like seed of spelt thats sown 
a forest tree it grows from sapling young 
eating its leaves the harpies cause it pain 
and open loopholes whence its sighs are wrung 
we for our vestments shall return again 
like others but in them shall neer be clad 
men justly lose what from themselves theyve taen 
dragged hither by us all throughout the sad 
forest our bodies shall be hung on high 
each on the thorn of its destructive shade 
while to the trunk we listening lingered nigh 
thinking he might proceed to tell us more 
a sudden uproar we were startled by 
like him who that the huntsman and the boar 
to where he stands are sweeping in the chase 
knows by the crashing trees and brutish roar 
upon our left we saw a couple race 
naked and scratched and they so quickly fled 
the forest barriers burst before their face 
speed to my rescue death the foremost pled 
the next as wishing he could use more haste 
not thus o lano thee thy legs bested 
when one at toppos tournament thou wast 
then haply wanting breath aside he stepped 
merged with a bush on which himself he cast 
behind them through the forest onward swept 
a pack of dogs black ravenous and fleet 
like greyhounds from their leashes newly slipped 
in him who crouched they made their teeth to meet 
and having piecemeal all his members rent 
haled them away enduring anguish great 
grasping my hand my escort forward went 
and led me to the bush which all in vain 
through its ensanguined openings made lament 
james of st andrews it we heard complain 
what profit hadst thou making me thy shield 
for thy bad life doth blame to me pertain 
then halting there this speech my master held 
who wast thou that through many wounds dost sigh 
mingled with blood words big with sorrow swelled 
o souls that hither come was his reply 
to witness shameful outrage by me borne 
whence all my leaves torn off around me lie 
gather them to the root of this drear thorn 
my city for the baptist changed of yore 
her former patron wherefore in return 
he with his art will make her aye deplore 
and were it not some image doth remain 
of him where arnos crossed from shore to shore 
those citizens who founded her again 
on ashes left by attila had spent 
their labour of a surety all in vain 
in my own house i up a gibbet went 



canto xiv 


me of my native place the dear constraint 
led to restore the leaves which round were strewn 
to him whose voice by this time was grown faint 
thence came we where the second round joins on 
unto the third wherein how terrible 
the art of justice can be is well shown 
but clearly of these wondrous things to tell 
i say we entered on a plain of sand 
which from its bed doth every plant repel 
the dolorous wood lies round it like a band 
as that by the drear fosse is circled round 
upon its very edge we came to a stand 
and there was nothing within all that bound 
but burnt and heavy sand like that once trod 
beneath the feet of cato was the ground 
ah what a terror o revenge of god 
shouldst thou awake in any that may read 
of what before mine eyes was spread abroad 
i of great herds of naked souls took heed 
most piteously was weeping every one 
and different fortunes seemed to them decreed 
for some of them upon the ground lay prone 
and some were sitting huddled up and bent 
while others restless wandered up and down 
more numerous were they that roaming went 
than they that were tormented lying low 
but these had tongues more loosened to lament 
oer all the sand deliberate and slow 
broad open flakes of fire were downward rained 
as mong the alps in calm descends the snow 
such alexander saw when he attained 
the hottest india on his host they fell 
and all unbroken on the earth remained 
wherefore he bade his phalanxes tread well 
the ground because when taken one by one 
the burning flakes they could the better quell 
so here eternal fire was pouring down 
as tinder neath the steel so here the sands 
kindled whence pain more vehement was known 
and dancing up and down the wretched hands 
beat here and there for ever without rest 
brushing away from them the falling brands 
and i o master by all things confessed 
victor except by obdurate evil powers 
who at the gate to stop our passage pressed 
who is the enormous one who noway cowers 
beneath the fire with fierce disdainful air 
lying as if untortured by the showers 
and that same shade because he was aware 
that touching him i of my guide was fain 
to learn cried as in life myself i bear 
in death though jupiter should tire again 
his smith from whom he snatched in angry bout 
the bolt by which i at the last was slain 
though one by one he tire the others out 
at the black forge in mongibello placed 
while ho good vulcan help me he shall shout 
the cry he once at phlegras battle raised 
though hurled with all his might at me shall fly 
his bolts yet sweet revenge he shall not taste 
then spake my guide and in a voice so high 
never till then heard i from him such tone 
o capaneus because unquenchably 
thy pride doth burn worse pain by thee is known 
into no torture save thy madness wild 
fit for thy fury couldest thou be thrown 
then to me turning with a face more mild 
he said of the seven kings was he of old 
who leaguered thebes and as he god reviled 
him in small reverence still he seems to hold 
but for his bosom his own insolence 
supplies fit ornament as now i told 
now follow but take heed lest passing hence 
thy feet upon the burning sand should tread 
but keep them firm where runs the forest fence 
we reached a placenor any word we said 
where issues from the wood a streamlet small 
i shake but to recall its colour red 
like that which does from bulicamë fall 
and losel women later mong them share 
so through the sand this brooklets waters crawl 
its bottom and its banks i was aware 
were stone and stone the rims on either side 
from this i knew the passage must be there 
of all that i have shown thee as thy guide 
since when we by the gateway entered in 
whose threshold unto no one is denied 
nothing by thee has yet encountered been 
so worthy as this brook to cause surprise 
oer which the falling fireflakes quenched are seen 
these were my leaders words for full supplies 
i prayed him of the food of which to taste 
keen appetite he made within me rise 
in middle sea there lies a country waste 
known by the name of crete i then was told 
under whose king the world of yore was chaste 
there stands a mountain once the joyous hold 
of woods and streams as ida twas renowned 
now tis deserted like a thing grown old 
for a safe cradle twas by rhea found 
to nurse her child in and his infant cry 
lest it betrayed him she with clamours drowned 
within the mount an old man towereth high 
towards damietta are his shoulders thrown 
on rome as on his mirror rests his eye 
his head is fashioned of pure gold alone 
of purest silver are his arms and chest 
tis brass to where his legs divide then down 
from that is all of iron of the best 
save the right foot which is of baken clay 
and upon this foot doth he chiefly rest 
save what is gold doth every part display 
a fissure dripping tears these gathering all 
together through the grotto pierce a way 
from rock to rock into this deep they fall 
feed acheron and styx and phlegethon 
then downward travelling by this strait canal 
far as the place where further slope is none 
cocytus form and what that pool may be 
i say not now thoult see it further on 
if this brook rises he was asked by me 
within our world how comes it that no trace 
we saw of it till on this boundary 
and he replied thou knowest that the place 
is round and far as thou hast moved thy feet 
still to the left hand sinking to the base 
nathless thy circuit is not yet complete 
therefore if something new we chance to spy 
amazement needs not on thy face have seat 
i then but master where doth lethe lie 
and phlegethon of that thou sayest nought 
of this thou sayst those tears its flood supply 
it likes me well to be by thee besought 
but by the boiling red wave i was told 
to half thy question was an answer brought 
lethe not in this pit shalt thou behold 
thither to wash themselves the spirits go 
when penitence has made them spotless souled 
then said he from the wood tis fitting now 
that we depart behind me press thou nigh 
keep we the margins for they do not glow 
and over them ere fallen the fireflakes die 


canto xv 


now lies our way along one of the margins hard 
steam rising from the rivulet forms a cloud 
which gainst the fire doth brook and borders guard 
like walls the flemings timorous of the flood 
which towards them pours betwixt bruges and cadsand 
have made that oceans charge may be withstood 
or what the paduans on the brentas strand 
to guard their castles and their homesteads rear 
ere chiarentana feel the springtide bland 
of the same fashion did those dikes appear 
though not so high he made them nor so vast 
whoeer the builder was that piled them here 
we from the wood when we so far had passed 
i should not have distinguished where it lay 
though i to see it backward glance had cast 
a group of souls encountered on the way 
whose line of march was to the margin nigh 
each looked at usas by the new moons ray 
men peer at others neath the darkening sky 
sharpening his brows on us and only us 
like an old tailor on his needles eye 
and while that crowd was staring at me thus 
one of them knew me caught me by the gown 
and cried aloud lo this is marvellous 
and straightway while he thus to me held on 
i fixed mine eyes upon his firebaked face 
and spite of scorching seemed his features known 
and whose they were my memory well could trace 
and i with hand stretched toward his face below 
asked ser brunetto and is this your place 
o son he answered no displeasure show 
if now brunetto latini shall some way 
step back with thee and leave his troop to go 
i said with all my heart for this i pray 
and if you choose i by your side will sit 
if he for i go with him grant delay 
son said he who of us shall intermit 
motion a moment for an age must lie 
nor fan himself when flames are round him lit 
on therefore at thy skirts i follow nigh 
then shall i overtake my band again 
who mourn a loss large as eternity 
i dared not from the path step to the plain 
to walk with him but low i bent my head 
like one whose steps are all with reverence taen 
what fortune or what destiny he said 
hath brought thee here or eer thou death hast seen 
and who is this by whom thourt onward led 
up yonder said i in the life serene 
i in a valley wandered all forlorn 
before my years had full accomplished been 
i turned my back on it but yestermorn 
again i sought it when he came in sight 
guided by whom i homeward thus return 
and he to me following thy planets light 
thou of a glorious haven canst not fail 
if in the blithesome life i marked aright 
and had my years known more abundant tale 
seeing the heavens so held thee in their grace 
i heartening thee had helped thee to prevail 
but that ungrateful and malignant race 
which down from fiesole came long ago 
and still its rocky origin betrays 
will for thy worthiness become thy foe 
and with good reason for mong crabtrees wild 
it ill befits the mellow fig to grow 
by widespread ancient rumour are they styled 
a people blind rapacious envious vain 
see by their manners thou be not defiled 
fortune reserves such honour for thee fain 
both sides will be to enlist thee in their need 
but from the beak the herb shall far remain 
let beasts of fiesole go on to tread 
themselves to litter nor the plants molest 
if any such now spring on their rank bed 
in whom there flourishes indeed the blest 
seed of the romans who still lingered there 
when of such wickedness twas made the nest 
had i obtained full answer to my prayer 
you had not yet been doomed i then did say 
this exile from humanity to bear 
for deep within my heart and memory 
lives the paternal image good and dear 
of you as in the world from day to day 
how men escape oblivion you made clear 
my thankfulness for which shall in my speech 
while i have life as it behoves appear 
i note what of my future course you teach 
stored with another text it will be glozed 
by one expert should i that lady reach 
yet would i have this much to you disclosed 
if but my conscience no reproaches yield 
to all my fortune is my soul composed 
not new to me the hint by you revealed 
therefore let fortune turn her wheel apace 
even as she will the clown his mattock wield 
thereon my master right about did face 
and uttered this with glance upon me thrown 
he hears to purpose who doth mark the place 
and none the less i speaking still go on 
with ser brunetto asking him to tell 
who of his band are greatest and best known 
and he to me to hear of some is well 
but of the rest tis fitting to be dumb 
and time is lacking all their names to spell 
that all of them were clerks know thou in sum 
all men of letters famous and of might 
stained with one sin all from the world are come 
priscian goes with that crowd of evil plight 
francis daccorso too and hadst thou mind 
for suchlike trash thou mightest have had sight 
of him the slave of slaves to change assigned 
from arnos banks to bacchiglione where 
his nerves fatigued with vice he left behind 
more would i say but neither must i fare 
nor talk at further length for from the sand 
i see new dustclouds rising in the air 
i may not keep with such as are at hand 
care for my treasure for i still survive 
in that my work i nothing else demand 
then turned he back and ran like those who strive 
for the green cloth upon veronas plain 
and seemed like him that shall the first arrive 
and not like him that labours all in vain 


canto xvi 


now could i hear the water as it fell 
to the next circle with a murmuring sound 
like what is heard from swarming hives to swell 
when three shades all together with a bound 
burst from a troop met by us pressing on 
neath rain of that sharp torment oer the ground 
toward us approaching they exclaimed each one 
halt thou whom from thy garb we judge to be 
a citizen of our corrupted town 
alas what scars i on their limbs did see 
both old and recent which the flames had made 
even now my ruth is fed by memory 
my teacher halted at their cry and said 
await a while and looked me in the face 
some courtesy to these were well displayed 
and but that firethe manner of the place 
descends for ever fitting twere to find 
rather than them thee quickening thy pace 
when we had halted they again combined 
in their old song and reaching where we stood 
into a wheel all three were intertwined 
and as the athletes used well oiled and nude 
to feel their grip and wary watch their chance 
ere they to purpose strike and wrestle could 
so each of them kept fixed on me his glance 
as he wheeled round and in opposing ways 
his neck and feet seemed ever to advance 
ah if the misery of this sandstrewn place 
bring us and our petitions in despite 
one then began and flayed and grimy face 
let at the least our fame goodwill incite 
to tell us who thou art whose living feet 
thus through inferno wander without fright 
for he whose footprints as thou seest i beat 
though now he goes with body peeled and nude 
more than thou thinkest in the world was great 
the grandson was he of gualdrada good 
he guidoguerra with his armèd hand 
did mighty things and by his counsel shrewd 
the other who behind me treads the sand 
is one whose name should on the earth be dear 
for he is tegghiaio aldobrand 
and i who am tormented with them here 
james rusticucci was my fierce and proud 
wife of my ruin was chief minister 
if from the fire there had been any shroud 
i should have leaped down mong them nor have earned 
blame for my teacher sure had this allowed 
but since i should have been all baked and burned 
terror prevailed the goodwill to restrain 
with which to clasp them in my arms i yearned 
then i began twas not contempt but pain 
which your condition in my breast awoke 
where deeply rooted it will long remain 
when this my master words unto me spoke 
by which expectancy was in me stirred 
that ye who came were honourable folk 
i of your city am and with my word 
your deeds and honoured names oft to recall 
delighted and with joy of them i heard 
to the sweet fruits i go and leave the gall 
as promised to me by my escort true 
but first i to the centre down must fall 
so may thy soul thy members long endue 
with vital power the other made reply 
and after thee thy fame its light renew 
as thou shalt tell if worth and courtesy 
within our city as of yore remain 
or from it have been wholly forced to fly 
for william borsier one of yonder train 
and but of late joined with us in this woe 
causeth us with his words exceeding pain 
upstarts and fortunes suddenly that grow 
have bred in thee pride and extravagance 
whence tears o florence thou art shedding now 
thus cried i with uplifted countenance 
the three accepting it for a reply 
glanced each at each as hearing truth men glance 
and all if others thou shalt satisfy 
as well at other times at no more cost 
happy thus at thine ease the truth to cry 
therefore if thou escapst these regions lost 
returning to behold the starlight fair 
then when there was i thou shalt make thy boast 
something of us do thou mong men declare 
then broken was the wheel and as they fled 
their nimble legs like pinions beat the air 
so much as one amen had scarce been said 
quicker than what they vanished from our view 
on this once more the way my master led 
i followed and ere long so near we drew 
to where the water fell that for its roar 
speech scarcely had been heard between us two 
and as the stream which of all those which pour 
east from mount viso counting by its own 
course falls the first from apennine to shore 
as acquacheta in the uplands known 
by name ere plunging to its bed profound 
name lost ere by forlì its waters run 
above st benedict with one long bound 
where for a thousand would be ample room 
falls from the mountain to the lower ground 
down the steep cliff that water dyed in gloom 
we found to fall echoing from side to side 
stunning the ear with its tremendous boom 
there was a cord about my middle tied 
with which i once had thought that i might hold 
secure the leopard with the painted hide 
when this from round me i had quite unrolled 
to him i handed it all coiled and tight 
as by my leader i had first been told 
himself then bending somewhat toward the right 
he just beyond the edge of the abyss 
threw down the cord which disappeared from sight 
that some strange thing will follow upon this 
unwonted signal which my masters eye 
thus follows so i thought can hardly miss 
ah what great caution need we standing by 
those who behold not only what is done 
but who have wit our hidden thoughts to spy 
he said to me there shall emerge and soon 
what i await and quickly to thy view 
that which thou dreamst of shall be clearly known 
from utterance of truth which seems untrue 
a man wheneer he can should guard his tongue 
lest he win blame to no transgression due 
yet now i must speak out and by the song 
of this my comedy reader i swear 
so in good liking may it last full long 
i saw a shape swim upward through that air 
all indistinct with gross obscurity 
enough to fill the stoutest heart with fear 
like one who rises having dived to free 
an anchor grappled on a jagged stone 
or something else deep hidden in the sea 
with feet drawn in and arms all open thrown 



canto xvii 


behold the monster with the pointed tail 
who passes mountains and can entrance make 
through arms and walls who makes the whole world ail 
corrupted by him thus my leader spake 
and beckoned him that he should land hard by 
where short the pathways built of marble break 
and that foul image of dishonesty 
moving approached us with his head and chest 
but to the bank drew not his tail on high 
his face a human righteousness expressed 
twas so benignant to the outward view 
a serpent was he as to all the rest 
on both his arms hair to the armpits grew 
on back and chest and either flank were knot 
and rounded shield portrayed in various hue 
no turk or tartar weaver ever brought 
to ground or pattern a more varied dye 
nor by arachne was such broidery wrought 
as sometimes by the shore the barges lie 
partly in water partly on dry land 
and as afar in gluttonous germany 
watching their prey alert the beavers stand 
so did this worst of brutes his foreparts fling 
upon the stony rim which hems the sand 
all of his tail in space was quivering 
its poisoned fork erecting in the air 
which scorpionlike was armèd with a sting 
my leader said now we aside must fare 
a little distance so shall we attain 
unto the beast malignant crouching there 
so we stepped down upon the right and then 
a half score steps to the outer edge did pace 
thus clearing well the sand and fiery rain 
and when we were hard by him i could trace 
upon the sand a little further on 
some people sitting near to the abyss 
that what this belt containeth may be known 
completely by thee then the master said 
to see their case do thou advance alone 
let thy inquiries be succinctly made 
while thou art absent i will ask of him 
with his strong shoulders to afford us aid 
then all alone i on the outmost rim 
of that seventh circle still advancing trod 
where sat a woful folk full to the brim 
their eyes with anguish were and overflowed 
their hands moved here and there to win some ease 
now from the flames now from the soil which glowed 
no otherwise in summertime one sees 
working its muzzle and its paws the hound 
when bit by gnats or plagued with flies or fleas 
and i on scanning some who sat around 
of those on whom the dolorous flames alight 
could recognise not one i only found 
a purse hung from the throat of every wight 
each with its emblem and its special hue 
and every eye seemed feasting on the sight 
as i beholding them among them drew 
i saw what seemed a lions face and mien 
upon a yellow purse designed in blue 
still moving on mine eyes athwart the scene 
i saw another scrip bloodred display 
a goose more white than butter could have been 
and one on whose white wallet blazoned lay 
a pregnant sow in azure to me said 
what dost thou in this pit do thou straightway 
begone and seeing thou art not yet dead 
know that vitalian neighbour once of mine 
shall on my left flank one day find his bed 
a paduan i all these are florentine 
and oft they stun me bellowing in my ear 
come pink of chivalry for whom we pine 
whose is the purse on which three beaks appear 
then he from mouth awry his tongue thrust out 
like ox that licks its nose and i in fear 
lest more delay should stir in him some doubt 
who gave command i should not linger long 
me from those wearied spirits turned about 
i found my guide who had already sprung 
upon the back of that fierce animal 
he said to me now be thou brave and strong 
by stairs like this we henceforth down must fall 
mount thou in front for i between would sit 
so thee the tail shall harm not nor appal 
like one so close upon the shivering fit 
of quartan ague that his nails grow blue 
and seeing shade he trembles every whit 
i at the hearing of that order grew 
but his threats shamed me as before the face 
of a brave lord his man grows valorous too 
on the great shoulders then i took my place 
and wished to say but could not move my tongue 
as i expected do thou me embrace 
but he who other times had helped me mong 
my other perils when ascent i made 
sustained me and strong arms around me flung 
and geryon set thee now in motion said 
wheel widely let thy downward flight be slow 
think of the novel burden on thee laid 
as from the shore a boat begins to go 
backward at first so now he backward pressed 
and when he found that all was clear below 
he turned his tail where earlier was his breast 
and stretching it he moved it like an eel 
while with his paws he drew air toward his chest 
more terror phaëthon could hardly feel 
what time he let the reins abandoned fall 
whence heaven was fired as still its tracts reveal 
nor wretched icarus on finding all 
his plumage moulting as the wax grew hot 
while the wrong road his father loud did call 
than what i felt on finding i was brought 
where nothing was but air and emptiness 
for save the brute i could distinguish nought 
he slowly slowly swims to the abyss 
wheeling he makes descent as i surmise 
from wind felt neath my feet and in my face 
already on the right i heard arise 
from out the caldron a terrific roar 
whereon i stretch my head with downturned eyes 
terror of falling now oppressed me sore 
hearing laments and seeing fires that burned 
my thighs i tightened trembling more and more 
earlier i had not by the eye discerned 
that we swept downward scenes of torment now 
seemed drawing nearer wheresoeer we turned 
and as a falcon which long time doth go 
upon the wing not finding lure or prey 
while ha the falconer cries descending so 
comes wearied back whence swift it soared away 
wheeling a hundred times upon the road 
then from its master far sulks angrily 
so we by geryon in the deep bestowed 
were neath the sheerhewn precipice set down 
he suddenly delivered from our load 
like arrow from the string was swiftly gone 



canto xviii 


of iron colour and composed of stone 
a place called malebolge is in hell 
girt by a cliff of substance like its own 
in that malignant region yawns a well 
right in the centre ample and profound 
of which i duly will the structure tell 
the zone that lies between them then is round 
between the well and precipice hard and high 
into ten vales divided is the ground 
as is the figure offered to the eye 
where numerous moats a castles towers enclose 
that they the walls may better fortify 
a like appearance was made here by those 
and as again from threshold of such place 
many a drawbridge to the outworks goes 
so ridges from the precipices base 
cutting athwart the moats and barriers run 
till at the well join the extremities 
from geryons back when we were shaken down 
twas here we stood until the poets feet 
moved to the left and i behind came on 
new torments on the right mine eyes did meet 
with new tormentors novel woe on woe 
with which the nearer bolgia was replete 
sinners all naked in the gulf below 
this side the middle met us while they strode 
on that side with us but more swift did go 
even so the romans that the mighty crowd 
across the bridge the year of jubilee 
might pass with ease ordained a rule of road 
facing the castle on that side should be 
the multitude which to st peters hied 
so to the mount on this was passage free 
on the grim rocky ground on either side 
i saw horned devils armed with heavy whip 
which on the sinners from behind they plied 
ah how they made the wretches nimbly skip 
at the first lashes no one ever yet 
but sought from the second and the third to slip 
and as i onward went mine eyes were set 
on one of them whereon i called in haste 
this one already i have surely met 
therefore to know him fixedly i gazed 
and my kind leader willingly delayed 
while for a little i my course retraced 
on this the scourged one thinking to evade 
my search his visage bent without avail 
for thou that gazest on the ground i said 
if these thy features tell trustworthy tale 
venedico caccianimico thou 
but what has brought thee to such sharp regale 
and he i tell it gainst my will i trow 
but thy clear accents to the old world bear 
my memory and make me all avow 
i was the man who ghisola the fair 
to serve the marquis evil will led on 
whatever the uncomely tale declare 
of bolognese here weeping not alone 
am i so full the place of them today 
tween reno and savena are not known 
so many tongues that sipa deftly say 
and if of this thoudst know the reason why 
think but how greedy were our hearts alway 
to him thus speaking did a demon cry 
pander begone and smote him with his thong 
here are no women for thy coin to buy 
then with my escort joined i moved along 
few steps we made until we there had come 
where from the bank a rib of rock was flung 
with ease enough up to its top we clomb 
and turning on the ridge bore to the right 
and those eternal circles parted from 
when we had reached where underneath the height 
a passage opes yielding the scourged a way 
my guide bade tarry so to hold in sight 
those other spirits born in evil day 
whose faces until now from thee have been 
concealed because with ours their progress lay 
then from the ancient bridge by us were seen 
the troop which toward us on that circuit sped 
chased onward likewise by the scourges keen 
and my good master ere i asked him said 
that lordly one now coming hither see 
by whom despite of pain no tears are shed 
what mien he still retains of majesty 
tis jason who by courage and by guile 
the colchians of the ram deprived twas he 
who on his passage by the lemnian isle 
where all of womankind with daring hand 
upon their males had wrought a murder vile 
with loving pledges and with speeches bland 
the tenderyeared hypsipyle betrayed 
who had herself a fraud on others planned 
forlorn he left her then when pregnant made 
that is the crime condemns him to this pain 
and for medea too is vengeance paid 
who in his manner cheat compose his train 
of the first moat sufficient now is known 
and those who in its jaws engulfed remain 
already had we by the strait path gone 
to where tis with the second bank dovetailed 
the buttress whence a second arch is thrown 
here heard we who in the next bolgia wailed 
and puffed for breath reverberations told 
they with their open palms themselves assailed 
the sides were crusted over with a mould 
plastered upon them by foul mists that rise 
and both with eyes and nose a contest hold 
the bottom is so deep in vain our eyes 
searched it till further up the bridge we went 
to where the arch oerhangs what under lies 
ascended there our eyes we downward bent 
and i saw people in such ordure drowned 
a very cesspool twas of excrement 
and while i from above am searching round 
one with a head so filthsmeared i picked out 
i knew not if twas lay or tonsurecrowned 
why then so eager asked he with a shout 
to stare at me of all the filthy crew 
and i to him because i scarce can doubt 
that formerly thee dry of hair i knew 
alessio interminei the lucchese 
and therefore thee i chiefly hold in view 
smiting his headpiece then his words were these 
twas flattery steeped me here for using such 
my tongue itself enough could never please 
now stretch thou somewhat forward but not much 
thereon my leader bade me and thine eyes 
slowly advance till they her features touch 
and the dishevelled baggage recognise 
clawing her yonder with her nails unclean 
now standing up now squatting on her thighs 
tis harlot thais who when she had been 
asked by her lover am i generous 
and worthy thanks said greatly so i ween 
enough of this place has been seen by us 




canto xix 


o simon magus ye his wretched crew 
the gifts of god ordained to be the bride 
of righteousness ye prostitute that you 
with gold and silver may be satisfied 
therefore for you let now the trumpet blow 
seeing that ye in the third bolgia bide 
arrived at the next tomb we to the brow 
of rock ere this had finished our ascent 
which hangs true plumb above the pit below 
what perfect art o thou omniscient 
is thine in heaven and earth and the bad world found 
how justly does thy power its dooms invent 
the livid stone on both banks and the ground 
i saw was full of holes on every side 
all of one size and each of them was round 
no larger seemed they to me nor less wide 
than those within my beautiful st john 
for the baptizers standingplace supplied 
and one of which not many years agone 
i broke to save one drowning and i would 
have this for seal to undeceive men known 
out of the mouth of each were seen protrude 
a sinners feet and of the legs the small 
far as the calves the rest enveloped stood 
and set on fire were both the soles of all 
which made their ankles wriggle with such throes 
as had made ropes and withes asunder fall 
and as flame fed by unctuous matter goes 
over the outer surface only spread 
so from their heels it flickered to the toes 
master who is he tortured more i said 
than are his neighbours writhing in such woe 
and licked by flames of deeperhearted red 
and he if thou desirest that below 
i bear thee by that bank which lowest lies 
thou from himself his sins and name shalt know 
and i thy wishes still for me suffice 
thou art my lord and knowest i obey 
thy will and dost my hidden thoughts surprise 
to the fourth barrier then we made our way 
and to the left hand turning downward went 
into the narrow holepierced cavity 
nor the good master caused me make descent 
from off his haunch till we his hole were nigh 
who with his shanks was making such lament 
whoeer thou art soul full of misery 
set like a stake with lower end upcast 
i said to him make if thou canst reply 
i like a friar stood who gives the last 
shrift to a vile assassin to his side 
called back to win delay for him fixed fast 
art thou arrived already then he cried 
art thou arrived already boniface 
by several years the prophecy has lied 
art so soon wearied of the wealthy place 
for which thou didst not fear to take with guile 
then ruin the fair lady now my case 
was like to theirs who linger on the while 
they cannot comprehend what they are told 
and as befooled from further speech resile 
but virgil bade me speak out loud and bold 
i am not he thou thinkest no not he 
and i made answer as by him controlled 
the spirits feet then twisted violently 
and sighing in a voice of deep distress 
he asked what then requirest thou of me 
if me to know thou hast such eagerness 
that thou the cliff hast therefore ventured down 
know the great mantle sometime was my dress 
i of the bear in sooth was worthy son 
as once the cubs to help my purse with gain 
i stuffed myself i in this purse have stown 
stretched out at length beneath my head remain 
all the simoniacs that before me went 
and flattened lie throughout the rocky vein 
i in my turn shall also make descent 
soon as he comes who i believed thou wast 
when i asked quickly what for him was meant 
oer me with blazing feet more time has past 
while upside down i fill the topmost room 
than he his crimsoned feet shall upward cast 
for after him one viler still shall come 
a pastor from the west lawless of deed 
to cover both of us his worthy doom 
a modern jason he of whom we read 
in maccabees whose king denied him nought 
with the french king so shall this man succeed 
perchance i ventured further than i ought 
but i spake to him in this measure free 
ah tell me now what money was there sought 
of peter by our lord when either key 
he gave him in his guardianship to hold 
sure he demanded nought save follow me 
nor peter nor the others asked for gold 
or silver when upon matthias fell 
the lot instead of him the traitorsouled 
keep then thy place for thou art punished well 
and clutch the pelf dishonourably gained 
which against charles made thee so proudly swell 
and were it not that i am still restrained 
by reverence for those tremendous keys 
borne by thee while the glad world thee contained 
i would use words even heavier than these 
seeing your avarice makes the world deplore 
crushing the good filling the bad with ease 
twas you o pastors the evangelist bore 
in mind what time he saw her on the flood 
of waters set who played with kings the whore 
who with seven heads was born and as she would 
by the ten horns to her was service done 
long as her spouse rejoiced in what was good 
now gold and silver are your god alone 
what difference twixt the idolater and you 
save that ye pray a hundred for his one 
ah constantine how many evils grew 
not from thy change of faith but from the gift 
wherewith thou didst the first rich pope endue 
while i my voice continued to uplift 
to such a tune by rage or conscience stirred 
both of his soles he made to twist and shift 
my guide i well believe with pleasure heard 
listening he stood with lips so well content 
to me propounding truthful word on word 
then round my body both his arms he bent 
and having raised me well upon his breast 
climbed up the path by which he made descent 
nor was he by his burden so oppressed 
but that he bore me to the bridges crown 
which with the fourth joins the fifth ramparts crest 
and lightly here he set his burden down 
found light by him upon the precipice 
up which a goat uneasily had gone 
and thence another valley met mine eyes 



canto xx 


now of new torment must my verses tell 
and matter for the twentieth canto win 
of lay the first which treats of souls in hell 
already was i eager to begin 
to peer into the visible profound 
which tears of agony was bathèd in 
and i saw people in the valley round 
like that of penitents on earth the pace 
at which they weeping came nor uttering sound 
when i beheld them with more downcast gaze 
that each was strangely screwed about i learned 
where chest is joined to chin and thus the face 
of every one round to his loins was turned 
and stepping backward all were forced to go 
for nought in front could be by them discerned 
smitten by palsy although one might show 
perhaps a shape thus twisted all awry 
i never saw and am to think it slow 
as reader god may grant thou profit by 
thy reading for thyself consider well 
if i could then preserve my visage dry 
when close at hand to me was visible 
our human form so wrenched that tears rained down 
out of the eyes between the buttocks fell 
in very sooth i wept leaning upon 
a boss of the hard cliff till on this wise 
my escort asked of the other fools art one 
here piety revives as pity dies 
for who more irreligious is than he 
in whom gods judgments to regret give rise 
lift up lift up thy head and thou shalt see 
him for whom earth yawned as the thebans saw 
all shouting meanwhile whither dost thou flee 
amphiaraüs wherefore thus withdraw 
from battle but he sinking found no rest 
till minos clutched him with allgrasping claw 
lo how his shoulders serve him for a breast 
because he wished to see too far before 
backward he looks to backward course addressed 
behold tiresias who was changed all oer 
till for a man a woman met the sight 
and not a limb its former semblance bore 
and he behoved a second time to smite 
the same two twisted serpents with his wand 
ere he again in manly plumes was dight 
with back to him see aruns next at hand 
who up among the hills of luni where 
peasants of near carrara till the land 
among the dazzling marbles held his lair 
within a cavern whence could be descried 
the sea and stars of all obstruction bare 
the other one whose flowing tresses hide 
her bosom of the which thou seest nought 
and all whose hair falls on the further side 
was manto who through many regions sought 
where i was born at last her foot she stayed 
it likes me well thou shouldst of this be taught 
when from this life her father exit made 
and bacchus city had become enthralled 
she for long time through many countries strayed 
neath mountains by which germany is walled 
and bounded at tirol a lake there lies 
high in fair italy benacus called 
the waters of a thousand springs that rise 
twixt val camonica and garda flow 
down pennine and their flood this lake supplies 
and from a spot midway if they should go 
thither the pastors of verona trent 
and brescia might their blessings all bestow 
peschiera with its strength for ornament 
facing the brescians and the bergamese 
lies where the bank to lower curve is bent 
and there the waters seeking more of ease 
for in benacus is not room for all 
forming a river lapse by green degrees 
the river from its very source men call 
no more benacustis as mincio known 
which into po does at governo fall 
a flat it reaches ere it far has run 
spreading oer which it feeds a marshy fen 
whence oft in summer pestilence has grown 
wayfaring here the cruel virgin when 
she found land girdled by the marshy flood 
untilled and uninhabited of men 
that she might scape all human neighbourhood 
stayed on it with her slaves her arts to ply 
and there her empty body was bestowed 
on this the people from the country nigh 
into that place came crowding for the spot 
girt by the swamp could all attack defy 
and for the town built oer her body sought 
a name from her who made it first her seat 
calling it mantua without casting lot 
the dwellers in it were in number great 
till stupid casalodi was befooled 
and victimised by pinamontes cheat 
hence shouldst thou ever hear now be thou schooled 
another story to my town assigned 
let by no fraud the truth be overruled 
and i thy reasonings master to my mind 
so cogent are and win my faith so well 
what others say i shall black embers find 
but of this people passing onward tell 
if thou of any something canst declare 
for all my thoughts on that intently dwell 
and then he said the one whose bearded hair 
falls from his cheeks upon his shoulders dun 
was when the land of greece of males so bare 
was grown the very cradles scarce held one 
an augur he with calchas gave the sign 
in aulis through the first rope knife to run 
eurypylus was he called and in some line 
of my high tragedy is sung the same 
as thou knowst well who madst it wholly thine 
that other thin of flank was known to fame 
as michael scott and of a verity 
he knew right well the black arts inmost game 
guido bonatti and asdente see 
who mourns he ever should have parted from 
his thread and leather but too late mourns he 
lo the unhappy women who left loom 
spindle and needle that they might divine 
with herb and image hastening mens doom 
but come for where the hemispheres confine 
cain and the thorns is falling to alight 
underneath seville on the ocean line 
the moon was full already yesternight 
which to recall thou shouldst be well content 
for in the wood she somewhat helped thy plight 
thus spake he to me while we forward went 


canto xxi 


conversing still from bridge to bridge we went 
but what our words i in my comedy 
care not to tell the top of the ascent 
holding we halted the next pit to spy 
of malebolge with plaints bootless all 
there darkness full of wonder met the eye 
as the venetians in their arsenal 
boil the tenacious pitch at wintertide 
to caulk the ships with for repairs that call 
for then they cannot sail and so instead 
one builds his bark afresh one stops with tow 
his vessels ribs by many a voyage tried 
one hammers at the poop one at the prow 
some fashion oars and others cables twine 
and others at the jib and main sails sew 
so not by fire but by an art divine 
pitch of thick substance boiled in that low hell 
and all the banks did as with plaster line 
i saw it but distinguished nothing well 
except the bubbles by the boiling raised 
now swelling up and ceasing now to swell 
while down upon it fixedly i gazed 
beware beware my leader to me said 
and drew me thence close to him i amazed 
turned sharply round like him who has delayed 
fain to behold the thing he ought to flee 
then losing nerve grows suddenly afraid 
nor lingers longer what there is to see 
for a black devil i beheld advance 
over the cliff behind us rapidly 
ah me how fierce was he of countenance 
what bitterness he in his gesture put 
as with spread wings he oer the ground did dance 
upon his shoulders prominent and acute 
was perched a sinner fast by either hip 
and him he held by tendon of the foot 
he from our bridge ho malebranche grip 
an elder brought from santa zitas town 
stuff him below myself once more i slip 
back to the place where lack of such is none 
there save bonturo barrates every man 
and no grows yes that money may be won 
he shot him down and oer the cliff began 
to run nor unchained mastiff oer the ground 
chasing a robber swifter ever ran 
the other sank then rose with back bent round 
but from beneath the bridge the devils cried 
not here the sacred countenance is found 
one swims not here as on the serchios tide 
so if thou wouldst not with our grapplers deal 
do not on surface of the pitch abide 
then he a hundred hooks was made to feel 
best dance down there they said the while to him 
where if thou canst thou on the sly mayst steal 
so scullions by the cooks are set to trim 
the caldrons and with forks the pieces steep 
down in the water that they may not swim 
and the good master said to me now creep 
behind a rocky splinter for a screen 
so from their knowledge thou thyself shalt keep 
and fear not thou although with outrage keen 
i be opposed for i am well prepared 
and formerly have in like contest been 
then passing from the bridges crown he fared 
to the sixth bank and when thereon he stood 
he needed courage doing what he dared 
in the same furious and tempestuous mood 
in which the dogs upon the beggar leap 
who halting suddenly seeks alms or food 
they issued forth from underneath the deep 
vault of the bridge with grapplers gainst him stretched 
but he exclaimed aloof and harmless keep 
ere i by any of your hooks be touched 
come one of you and to my words give ear 
and then advise you if i should be clutched 
all cried let malacoda then go near 
on which one moved the others standing still 
he coming said what will this help him here 
o malacoda is it credible 
that i am come my master then replied 
secure your opposition to repel 
without heavens will and fate upon my side 
let me advance for tis by heavens behest 
that i on this rough road another guide 
then was his haughty spirit so depressed 
he let his hook drop sudden to his feet 
and strike him not commanded all the rest 
my leader charged me thus thou from thy seat 
where mid the bridges ribs thou crouchest low 
rejoin me now in confidence complete 
whereon i to rejoin him was not slow 
and then the devils crowding came so near 
i feared they to their paction false might show 
so at caprona saw i footmen fear 
spite of their treaty when a multitude 
of foes received them crowding front and rear 
with all my body braced i closer stood 
to him my leader and intently eyed 
the aspect of them which was far from good 
lowering their grapplers mong themselves they cried 
shall i now tickle him upon the thigh 
yea see thou clip him deftly one replied 
the demon who in parley had drawn nigh 
unto my leader upon this turned round 
scarmiglione lay thy weapon by 
he said and then to us no way is found 
further along this cliff because undone 
all the sixth arch lies ruined on the ground 
but if it please you further to pass on 
over this rocky ridge advancing climb 
to the next rib where passage may be won 
yestreen but five hours later than this time 
twelve hundred sixtysix years reached an end 
since the way lost the wholeness of its prime 
thither i some of mine will straightway send 
to see that none peer forth to breathe the air 
go on with them you they will not offend 
you alichin and calcabrin prepare 
to move he bade cagnazzo thou as well 
guiding the ten thou barbariccia fare 
with draghignazzo libicocco fell 
fanged ciriatto graffiacane too 
set on mad rubicant and farfarel 
search on all quarters round the boiling glue 
let these go safe till at the bridge they be 
which doth unbroken oer the caverns go 
alas my master what is this i see 
said i unguided let us forward set 
if thou knowst how i wish no company 
if former caution thou dost not forget 
dost thou not mark how each his teeth doth grind 
the while toward us their brows are full of threat 
and he i would not fear should fill thy mind 
let them grin all they will and all they can 
tis at the wretches in the pitch confined 
they wheeled and down the left hand bank began 
to march but first each bit his tongue and passed 
the signal on to him who led the van 
he answered grossly as with trumpet blast 



canto xxii 


horsemen ive seen in march across the field 
hastening to charge or answering muster stand 
and sometimes too when forced their ground to yield 
i have seen skirmishers upon your land 
o aretines and those on foray sent 
with trumpet and with bell to sound command 
have seen jousts run and wellfought tournament 
with drum and signal from the castle shown 
and foreign music with familiar blent 
but neer by blast on such a trumpet blown 
beheld i horse or foot to motion brought 
nor ship by star or landmark guided on 
with the ten demons moved we from the spot 
ah cruel company but with the good 
in church and in the tavern with the sot 
still to the pitch was my attention glued 
fully to see what in the bolgia lay 
and who were in its burning mass imbrued 
as when the dolphins vaulted backs display 
warning to mariners they should prepare 
to trim their vessel ere the storm makes way 
so to assuage the pain he had to bear 
some wretch would show his back above the tide 
then swifter plunge than lightnings cleave the air 
and as the frogs close to the marshs side 
with muzzles thrust out of the water stand 
while feet and bodies carefully they hide 
so stood the sinners upon every hand 
but on beholding barbariccia nigh 
beneath the bubbles disappeared the band 
i saw what still my heart is shaken by 
one waiting as it sometimes comes to pass 
that one frog plunges one at rest doth lie 
and graffiacan who nearest to him was 
him upward drew clutching his pitchy hair 
to me he bore the look an otter has 
i of their names ere this was well aware 
for i gave heed unto the names of all 
when they at first were chosen now prepare 
and rubicante with thy talons fall 
upon him and flay well with many cries 
and one consent the accursed ones did call 
i said o master if in any wise 
thou canst find out who is the wretched wight 
thus at the mercy of his enemies 
whereon my guide drew full within his sight 
asking him whence he came and he replied 
in kingdom of navarre i first saw light 
me servant to a lord my mother tied 
through her i from a scoundrel sire did spring 
waster of goods and of himself beside 
as servant next to thiebault righteous king 
i set myself to ply barratorship 
and in this heat discharge my reckoning 
and ciriatto close upon whose lip 
on either side a boarlike tusk did stand 
made him to feel how one of them could rip 
the mouse had stumbled on the wild cat band 
but barbariccia locked him in embrace 
and off while i shall hug him gave command 
round to my master then he turned his face 
ask more of him if more thou wouldest know 
while he against their fury yet finds grace 
my leader asked declare now if below 
the pitch mong all the guilty there lies here 
a latian he replied short while ago 
from one i parted who to them lived near 
and would that i might use him still for shield 
then hook or claw i should no longer fear 
said libicocco too much grace we yield 
and in the sinners arm he fixed his hook 
and from it clean a fleshy fragment peeled 
but seeing draghignazzo also took 
aim at his legs the leader of the ten 
turned swiftly round on them with angry look 
on this they were a little quieted then 
of him who still gazed on his wound my guide 
without delay demanded thus again 
who was it whom in coming to the side 
thou sayst thou didst do ill to leave behind 
gomita of gallura he replied 
a vessel full of fraud of every kind 
who holding in his power his masters foes 
so used them him they bear in thankful mind 
for taking bribes he let slip all of those 
he says and he in other posts did worse 
and as a chieftain mong barrators rose 
don michael zanche doth with him converse 
from logodoro and with endless din 
they gossip of sardinian characters 
but look ah me how yonder one doth grin 
more would i say but that i am afraid 
he is about to claw me on the skin 
to farfarel the captain turned his head 
for as about to swoop he rolled his eye 
and cursed hawk preserve thy distance said 
if ye would talk with or would closer spy 
the frighted wretch began once more to say 
tuscans or lombards i will bring them nigh 
but let the malebranche first give way 
that of their vengeance they may not have fear 
and i to this same place where now i stay 
for me who am but one will bring seven near 
when i shall whistle as we use to do 
whenever on the surface we appear 
on this cagnazzo up his muzzle threw 
shaking his head and saying hear the cheat 
he has contrived to throw himself below 
then he who in devices was complete 
far too malicious in good sooth replied 
when for my friends i plan a sorer fate 
this alichin withstood not but denied 
the others counsel saying if thou fling 
thyself hence thee i strive not to outstride 
but oer the pitch ill dart upon the wing 
leave we the ridge and be the bank a shield 
and see if thou canst all of us outspring 
o reader hear a novel trick revealed 
all to the other side turned round their eyes 
he first who slowest was the boon to yield 
in choice of time the navarrese was wise 
taking firm stand himself he forward flung 
eluding thus their hostile purposes 
then with compunction each of them was stung 
but he the most whose slackness made them fail 
therefore he started caught upon his tongue 
but little it bested nor could prevail 
his wings gainst fear below the other went 
while he with upturned breast aloft did sail 
and as the falcon when on its descent 
the wild duck suddenly dives out of sight 
returns outwitted back and malcontent 
to be befooled filled calcabrin with spite 
hovering he followed wishing in his mind 
the wretch escaping should leave cause for fight 
when the barrator vanished from behind 
he on his comrade with his talons fell 
and clawed him bove the moat with him entwined 
the other was a sparhawk terrible 
to claw in turn together then the two 
plunged in the boiling pool the heat full well 
how to unlock their fierce embraces knew 
but yet they had no power to rise again 
so were their wings all plastered oer with glue 
then barbariccia mourning with his train 
caused four to fly forth to the other side 
with all their grapplers swift their flight was taen 
down to the place from either hand they glide 
reaching their hooks to those who were limed fast 
and now beneath the scum were being fried 
and from them thus engaged we onward passed 



canto xxiii 


silent alone not now with company 
we onward went one first and one behind 
as minor friars use to make their way 
on æsops fable wholly was my mind 
intent by reason of that contest new 
the fable where the frog and mouse we find 
for mo and issa are not more of hue 
than like the fable shall the fact appear 
if but considered with attention due 
and as from one thought springs the next so here 
out of my first arose another thought 
until within me doubled was my fear 
for thus i judged seeing through us were brought 
contempt upon them hurt and sore despite 
they needs must be to deep vexation wrought 
if anger to malevolence unite 
then will they us more cruelly pursue 
than dog the hare which almost feels its bite 
all my hair bristled i already knew 
with terror when i spake o master try 
to hide us quick and back i turned to view 
what lay behind for me they terrify 
these malebranche following us from dread 
i almost fancy i can feel them nigh 
and he were i a mirror backed with lead 
i should no truer glass that form of thine 
than all thy thought by mine is answered 
for even now thy thoughts accord with mine 
alike in drift and featured with one face 
and to suggest one counsel they combine 
if the right bank slope downward at this place 
to the next bolgia offering us a way 
swiftly shall we evade the imagined chase 
ere he completely could his purpose say 
i saw them with their wings extended wide 
close on us as of us to make their prey 
then quickly was i snatched up by my guide 
even as a mother when awaked by cries 
she sees the flames are kindling at her side 
delaying not seizes her child and flies 
careful for him her proper danger mocks 
nor even with one poor shift herself supplies 
and he stretched out upon the flinty rocks 
himself unto the precipice resigned 
which one side of the other bolgia blocks 
a swifter course neer held a stream confined 
that it may turn a mill within its race 
where near the buckets tis the most declined 
than was my masters down that rocks sheer face 
nor seemed i then his comrade as we sped 
but like a son locked in a sires embrace 
and barely had his feet struck on the bed 
of the low ground when they were seen to stand 
upon the crest no more a cause of dread 
for providence supreme who so had planned 
in the fifth bolgia they should minister 
them wholly from departure thence had banned 
neath us we saw a painted people fare 
weeping as on their way they circled slow 
crushed by fatigue to look at and despair 
cloaks had they on with hoods pulled down full low 
upon their eyes and fashioned as it seemed 
like those which at cologne for monks they sew 
the outer face was gilt so that it gleamed 
inside was all of lead of such a weight 
fredericks to these had been but straw esteemed 
o weary robes for an eternal state 
with them we turned to the left hand once more 
intent upon their tears disconsolate 
but those folk wearied with the loads they bore 
so slowly crept that still new company 
was ours at every footfall on the floor 
whence to my guide i said do thou now try 
to find some one by name or action known 
and as we go on all sides turn thine eye 
and one who recognised the tuscan tone 
called from behind us halt i you entreat 
who through the air obscure are hastening on 
haply in me thou what thou seekst shalt meet 
whereon my guide turned round and said await 
and keep thou time with pacing of his feet 
i stood and saw two manifesting great 
desire to join me by their countenance 
but their loads hampered them and passage strait 
and when arrived me with an eye askance 
they gazed on long time but no word they spoke 
then to each other turned held thus parlance 
his heaving throat proves him of living folk 
if they are of the dead how could they gain 
to walk uncovered by the heavy cloak 
then to me tuscan who dost now attain 
to the college of the hypocrites forlorn 
to tell us who thou art show no disdain 
and i to them i was both bred and born 
in the great city by fair arnos stream 
and wear the body i have always worn 
but who are ye whose suffering supreme 
makes tears as i behold to flood the cheek 
and what your mode of pain that thus doth gleam 
ah me the yellow mantles one to speak 
began are all of lead so thick its weight 
maketh the scales after this manner creak 
we merry friars of bolognas state 
i catalano loderingo he 
were by thy town together designate 
as for the most part one is used to be 
to keep the peace within it and around 
gardingo what we were men still may see 
i made beginning friars your profound 
but said no more on suddenly seeing there 
one crucified by three stakes to the ground 
who when he saw me writhed as in despair 
breathing into his beard with heavy sigh 
and friar catalan of this aware 
said he thus fixed on whom thou turnst thine eye 
counselled the pharisees that it behoved 
one man as victim for the folk should die 
naked thou seest he lies and neer removed 
from where set cross the path by him the weight 
of every one that passes by is proved 
and his wifes father shares an equal fate 
with others of the council in this fosse 
for to the jews they proved seed reprobate 
meanwhile at him thus stretched upon the cross 
virgil i saw displayed astonishment 
at his mean exile and eternal loss 
and then this question to the friars he sent 
be not displeased but if ye may avow 
if on the right hand there lies any vent 
by which we both of us from hence may go 
nor need the black angelic company 
to come to help us from this valley low 
nearer than what thou thinkst he made reply 
a rib there runs from the encircling wall 
the cruel vales in turn oerarching high 
save that at this tis rent and ruined all 
ye can climb upward oer the shattered heap 
where down the side the piledup fragments fall 
his head bent down a while my guide did keep 
then said he warned us in imperfect wise 
who sinners with his hook doth clutch and steep 
the friar at bologna many a vice 
i heard the devil charged with and among 
the rest that false he father is of lies 
then onward moved my guide with paces long 
and some slight shade of anger on his face 
i with him parted from the burdened throng 
stepping where those dear feet had left their trace 


canto xxiv 


in season of the new year when the sun 
beneath aquarius warms again his hair 
and somewhat on the nights the days have won 
when on the ground the hoarfrost painteth fair 
a mimic image of her sister white 
but soon her brush of colour is all bare 
the clown whose fodder is consumed outright 
rises and looks abroad and all the plain 
beholding glisten on his thigh doth smite 
returned indoors like wretch that seeks in vain 
what he should do restless he mourns his case 
but hope revives when looking forth again 
he sees the earth anew has changed its face 
then with his crook he doth himself provide 
and straightway doth his sheep to pasture chase 
so at my master was i terrified 
his brows beholding troubled nor more slow 
to where i ailed the plaster was applied 
for when the broken bridge we stood below 
my guide turned to me with the expression sweet 
which i beneath the mountain learned to know 
his arms he opened after counsel meet 
held with himself and scanning closely oer 
the fragments first he raised me from my feet 
and like a man who working looks before 
with foresight still on that in front bestowed 
me to the summit of a block he bore 
and then to me another fragment showed 
saying by this thou now must clamber on 
but try it first if it will bear thy load 
the heavy cowled this way could neer have gone 
for hardly we i holpen he so light 
could clamber up from shattered stone to stone 
and but that on the inner bank the height 
of wall is not so great i say not he 
but for myself i had been vanquished quite 
but malebolge to the cavity 
of the deep central pit is planned to fall 
hence every bolgia in its turn must be 
high on the out low on the inner wall 
so to the summit we attained at last 
whence breaks away the topmost stone of all 
my lungs were so with breathlessness harassed 
the summit won i could no further go 
and hardly there me on the ground i cast 
well it befits that thou shouldst from thee throw 
all sloth the master said for stretched in down 
or under awnings none can glory know 
and he who spends his life nor wins renown 
leaves in the world no more enduring trace 
than smoke in air or foam on water blown 
therefore arise oercome thy breathlessness 
by force of will victor in every fight 
when not subservient to the body base 
of stairs thou yet must climb a loftier flight 
tis not enough to have ascended these 
up then and profit if thou hearst aright 
rising i feigned to breathe with greater ease 
than what i felt and spake now forward plod 
for with my courage now my strength agrees 
up oer the rocky rib we held our road 
and rough it was and difficult and strait 
and steeper far than that we earlier trod 
speaking i went to hide my wearied state 
when from the neighbouring moat a voice we heard 
which seemed ill fitted to articulate 
of what it said i knew not any word 
though on the arch that vaults the moat set high 
but he who spake appeared by anger stirred 
though i bent downward yet my eager eye 
so dim the depth explored it all in vain 
i then o master to that bank draw nigh 
and let us by the wall descent obtain 
because i hear and do not understand 
and looking down distinguish nothing plain 
my sole reply to thee he answered bland 
is to perform for it behoves he said 
with silent act to answer just demand 
then we descended from the bridges head 
where with the eighth bank is its junction wrought 
and full beneath me was the bolgia spread 
and i perceived that hideously twas fraught 
with serpents and such monstrous forms they bore 
even now my blood is curdled at the thought 
henceforth let sandy libya boast no more 
though she breed hydra snake that crawls or flies 
twyheaded or finespeckled no such store 
of plagues nor near so cruel she supplies 
though joined to all the land of ethiop 
and that which by the red sea waters lies 
midst this fell throng and dismal without hope 
a naked people ran aghast with fear 
no covert for them and no heliotrope 
their hands were bound by serpents at their rear 
which in their reins for head and tail did get 
a holdingplace in front they knotted were 
and lo to one who on our side was set 
a serpent darted forward him to bite 
at where the neck is by the shoulders met 
nor o nor i did any ever write 
more quickly than he kindled burst in flame 
and crumbled all to ashes and when quite 
he on the earth a wasted heap became 
the ashes of themselves together rolled 
resuming suddenly their former frame 
thus as by mighty sages we are told 
the phoenix dies and then is born again 
when it is close upon five centuries old 
in all its life it eats not herb nor grain 
but only tears that from frankincense flow 
it for a shroud sweet nard and myrrh contain 
and as the man who falls and knows not how 
by force of demons stretched upon the ground 
or by obstruction that makes life run low 
when risen up straight gazes all around 
in deep confusion through the anguish keen 
he suffered from and stares with sighs profound 
so was the sinner when arisen seen 
justice of god how are thy terrors piled 
showering in vengeance blows thus big with teen 
my guide then asked of him how he was styled 
whereon he said from tuscany i rained 
not long ago into this gullet wild 
from bestial life not human joy i gained 
mule that i was me vanni fucci brute 
pistoia fitting den in life contained 
i to my guide bid him not budge a foot 
and ask what crime has plunged him here below 
in rage and blood i knew him dissolute 
the sinner heard nor insincere did show 
but towards me turned his face and eke his mind 
with spiteful shame his features all aglow 
then said it pains me more thou shouldst me find 
and catch me steeped in all this misery 
than when the other life i left behind 
what thou demandest i can not deny 
im plunged thus low because the thief i played 
within the fairly furnished sacristy 
and falsely to anothers charge twas laid 
lest thou shouldst joy such sight has met thy view 
if eer these dreary regions thou evade 
give ear and hearken to my utterance true 
the neri first out of pistoia fail 
her laws and parties florence shapes anew 
mars draws a vapour out of magras vale 
which black and threatening clouds accompany 
then bursting in a tempest terrible 
upon piceno shall the war run high 
the mist by it shall suddenly be rent 
and every bianco smitten be thereby 
and i have told thee that thou mayst lament 



canto xxv 


the robber when his words were ended so 
made both the figs and lifted either fist 
shouting there god for them at thee i throw 
then were the snakes my friends for one gan twist 
and coiled itself around the sinners throat 
as if to say now would i have thee whist 
another seized his arms and made a knot 
clinching itself upon them in such wise 
he had no power to move them by a jot 
pistoia thou pistoia shouldst devise 
to burn thyself to ashes since thou hast 
outrun thy founders in iniquities 
the blackest depths of hell through which i passed 
showed me no soul gainst god so filled with spite 
no not even he who down thebes wall was cast 
he spake no further word but turned to flight 
and i beheld a centaur raging sore 
come shouting of the ribald give me sight 
i scarce believe maremma yieldeth more 
snakes of all kinds than what composed the load 
which on his back far as our form he bore 
behind his nape with pinions spread abroad 
a dragon couchant on his shoulders lay 
to set on fire whoever bars his road 
this one is cacus did my master say 
who underneath the rock of aventine 
watered a pool with blood day after day 
not with his brethren runs he in the line 
because of yore the treacherous theft he wrought 
upon the neighbouring wealthy herd of kine 
whence to his crooked course an end was brought 
neath hercules club which on him might shower down 
a hundred blows ere ten he suffered nought 
while this he said the other had passed on 
and under us three spirits forward pressed 
of whom my guide and i had nothing known 
but that who are ye they made loud request 
whereon our tale no further could proceed 
and toward them wholly we our wits addressed 
i recognised them not but gave good heed 
till as it often haps in such a case 
to name another one discovered need 
saying now where stopped cianfa in the race 
then that my guide might halt and hearken well 
on chin and nose i did my finger place 
if reader to believe what now i tell 
thou shouldst be slow i wonder not for i 
who saw it all scarce find it credible 
while i on them my brows kept lifted high 
a serpent which had six feet suddenly flew 
at one of them and held him bodily 
its middle feet about his paunch it drew 
and with the two in front his arms clutched fast 
and bit one cheek and the other through and through 
its hinder feet upon his thighs it cast 
thrusting its tail between them till behind 
distended oer his reins it upward passed 
the ivy to a tree could never bind 
itself so firmly as this dreadful beast 
its members with the others intertwined 
each lost the colour that it once possessed 
and closely they like heated wax unite 
the former hue of neither manifest 
even so up oer papyrus when alight 
before the flame there spreads a colour dun 
not black as yet though from it dies the white 
the other two meanwhile were looking on 
crying agnello how art thou made new 
thou art not twain and yet no longer one 
a single head was moulded out of two 
and on our sight a single face arose 
which out of both lost countenances grew 
four separate limbs did but two arms compose 
belly with chest and legs with thighs did grow 
to members such as nought created shows 
their former fashion was all perished now 
the perverse shape did both yet neither seem 
and thus transformed departed moving slow 
and as the lizard which at fierce extreme 
of dogday heat another hedge would gain 
flits cross the path swift as the lightnings gleam 
right for the bellies of the other twain 
a little snake quivering with anger sped 
livid and black as is a pepper grain 
and on the part by which we first are fed 
pierced one of them and then upon the ground 
it fell before him and remained outspread 
the wounded gazed on it but made no sound 
rooted he stood and yawning scarce awake 
as seized by fever or by sleep profound 
it closely watched him and he watched the snake 
while from its mouth and from his wound gan swell 
volumes of smoke which joined one cloud to make 
be lucan henceforth dumb nor longer tell 
of plagued sabellus and nassidius 
but hearkening to what follows mark it well 
silent be ovid of him telling us 
how cadmus to a snake and to a fount 
changed arethuse i am not envious 
for never of two natures front to front 
in metamorphosis while mutually 
the forms their matter changed he gives account 
twas thus that each to the other made reply 
its tail into a fork the serpent split 
bracing his feet the other pulled them nigh 
and then in one so thoroughly were knit 
his legs and thighs no searching could divine 
at where the junction had been wrought in it 
the shape of which the one lost every sign 
the cloven tail was taking then the skin 
of one grew rough the others soft and fine 
i by the armpits saw the arms drawn in 
and now the monsters feet which had been small 
what the others lost in length appeared to win 
together twisted its hind feet did fall 
and grew the member men are used to hide 
for his the wretch gained feet with which to crawl 
dyed in the smoke they took on either side 
a novel colour hair unwonted grew 
on one the hair upon the other died 
the one fell prone erect the other drew 
with cruel eyes continuing to glare 
neath which their muzzles metamorphose knew 
the erect to his brows drew his of stuff to spare 
of what he upward pulled there was no lack 
so ears were formed on cheeks that erst were bare 
of that which clung in front nor was drawn back 
superfluous on the face was formed a nose 
and lips absorbed the skin that still was slack 
his muzzle who lay prone now forward goes 
backward into his head his ears he draws 
even as a snail appears its horns to lose 
the tongue which had been whole and ready was 
for speech cleaves now the forked tongue of the snake 
joins in the other and the smoke has pause 
the soul which thus a brutish form did take 
along the valley hissing swiftly fled 
the other close behind it spluttering spake 
then toward it turning his new shoulders said 
unto the third now buoso down the way 
may hasten crawling as i earlier sped 
ballast which in the seventh bolgia lay 
thus saw i shift and change be my excuse 
the novel theme if swerves my pen astray 
and though these things mine eyesight might confuse 
a little and my mind with fear divide 
such secrecy they fleeing could not use 
but that puccio sciancatto plain i spied 
and he alone of the companions three 
who came at first was left unmodified 
for the other tears gaville are shed by thee 


canto xxvi 


rejoice o florence in thy widening fame 
thy wings thou beatest over land and sea 
and even through inferno spreads thy name 
burghers of thine five such were found by me 
among the thieves whence i ashamed grew 
nor shall great glory thence redound to thee 
but if tis toward the morning dreams are true 
thou shalt experience ere long time be gone 
the doom even prato prays for as thy due 
and came it now it would not come too soon 
would it were come as come it must with time 
twill crush me more the older i am grown 
departing thence my guide began to climb 
the jutting rocks by which we made descent 
some while ago and pulled me after him 
and as upon our lonely way we went 
mong splinters of the cliff the feet in vain 
without the hand to help had labour spent 
i sorrowed and am sorrowsmit again 
recalling what before mine eyes there lay 
and more than i am wont my genius rein 
from running save where virtue leads the way 
so that if happy star or holier might 
have gifted me i never mourn it may 
at time of year when he who gives earth light 
his face shows to us longest visible 
when gnats replace the fly at fall of night 
not by the peasant resting on the hill 
are seen more fireflies in the vale below 
where he perchance doth field and vineyard till 
than flamelets i beheld resplendent glow 
throughout the whole eighth bolgia when at last 
i stood whence i the bottom plain could know 
and as he whom the bears avenged when passed 
from the earth elijah saw the chariot rise 
with horses heavenward reared and mounting fast 
and no long time had traced it with his eyes 
till but a flash of light it all became 
which like a rack of cloud swept to the skies 
deep in the valleys gorge in mode the same 
these flitted what it held by none was shown 
and yet a sinner lurked in every flame 
to see them well i from the bridge peered down 
and if a jutting crag i had not caught 
i must have fallen though neither thrust nor thrown 
my leader me beholding lost in thought 
in all the fires are spirits said to me 
his flame round each is for a garment wrought 
o master i replied by hearing thee 
i grow assured but yet i knew before 
that thus indeed it was and longed to be 
told who is in the flame which there doth soar 
cloven as if ascending from the pyre 
where with eteocles there burned of yore 
his brother he ulysses in that fire 
and diomedes burn in punishment 
thus held together as they held in ire 
and wrapped within their flame they now repent 
the ambush of the horse which oped the door 
through which the romans noble seed forth went 
for guile deïdamia makes deplore 
in death her lost achilles tears they shed 
and bear for the palladium vengeance sore 
master i pray thee fervently i said 
if from those flames they still can utter speech 
give ear as if a thousand times i pled 
refuse not here to linger i beseech 
until the cloven fire shall hither gain 
thou seest how toward it eagerly i reach 
and he thy prayers are worthy to obtain 
exceeding praise thou hast what thou dost seek 
but see that thou from speech thy tongue refrain 
i know what thou wouldst have leave me to speak 
for they perchance would hear contemptuously 
shouldst thou address them seeing they were greek 
soon as the flame toward us had come so nigh 
that to my leader time and place seemed met 
i heard him thus adjure it to reply 
o ye who twain within one fire are set 
if what i did your guerdon meriteth 
if much or little ye are in my debt 
for the great verse i built while i had breath 
by one of you be openly confessed 
where lost to men at last he met with death 
of the ancient flame the more conspicuous crest 
murmuring began to waver up and down 
like flame that flickers by the wind distressed 
at length by it was measured motion shown 
like tongue that moves in speech and by the flame 
was language uttered thus when i had gone 
from circe who a long year kept me tame 
beside her ere the near gaeta had 
receivèd from æneas that new name 
no softness for my son nor reverence sad 
for my old father nor the love i owed 
penelope with which to make her glad 
could quench the ardour that within me glowed 
a full experience of the world to gain 
of human vice and worth but i abroad 
launched out upon the high and open main 
with but one bark and but the little band 
which neer deserted me as far as spain 
i saw the seashore upon either hand 
and as morocco saw sardinias isle 
and all of which those waters wash the strand 
i and my comrades were grown old the while 
and sluggish ere we to the narrows came 
where hercules of old did landmarks pile 
for sign to men they should no further aim 
and seville lay behind me on the right 
as on the left lay ceuta then to them 
i spake o brothers who through such a fight 
of hundred thousand dangers west have won 
in this short watch that ushers in the night 
of all your senses ere your day be done 
refuse not to obtain experience new 
of worlds unpeopled yonder past the sun 
consider whence the seed of life ye drew 
ye were not born to live like brutish herd 
but righteousness and wisdom to ensue 
my comrades to such eagerness were stirred 
by this short speech the course to enter on 
they had no longer brooked restraining word 
turning our poop to where the morning shone 
we of the oars made wings for our mad flight 
still tending left the further we had gone 
and of the other pole i saw at night 
now all the stars and neath the watery plain 
our own familiar heavens were lost to sight 
five times afresh had kindled and again 
the moons face earthward was illumed no more 
since out we sailed upon the mighty main 
then we beheld a lofty mountain soar 
dim in the distance higher as i thought 
by far than any i had seen before 
we joyed but with despair were soon distraught 
when burst a whirlwind from the newfound world 
and the forequarter of the vessel caught 
with all the waters thrice it round was swirled 
at the fourth time the poop heaved upward rose 
the prow as pleased another down was hurled 
and then above us did the ocean close 


canto xxvii 


now having first erect and silent grown 
for it would say no more from us the flame 
the poet sweet consenting had moved on 
and then our eyes were turned to one that came 
behind it on the way by sounds that burst 
out of its crest in a confusèd stream 
as the sicilian bull which bellowed first 
with his lamentingand it was but right 
who had prepared it with his tools accurst 
roared with the howlings of the tortured wight 
so that although constructed all of brass 
yet seemed it pierced with anguish to the height 
so wanting road and vent by which to pass 
up through the flame into the flames own speech 
the woeful language all converted was 
but when the words at length contrived to reach 
the top while hither thither shook the crest 
as moved the tongue at utterance of each 
we heard oh thou to whom are now addressed 
my words who spakest now in lombard phrase 
depart of thee i nothing more request 
though i be late arrived yet of thy grace 
let it not irk thee here a while to stay 
it irks not me yet as thou seest i blaze 
if lately to this world devoid of day 
from that sweet latian land thou art come down 
whence all my guilt i bring declare and say 
has now romagna peace because my own 
native abode was in the mountain land 
tween springs of tiber and urbino town 
while i intent and bending low did stand 
my leader as he touched me on the side 
speak thou for he is latian gave command 
whereon without delay i thus replied 
because already was my speech prepared 
soul that down there dost in concealment bide 
in thy romagna wars have never spared 
and spare not now in tyrants hearts to rage 
but when i left it there was none declared 
no change has fallen ravenna for an age 
there covering cervia too with outspread wing 
polentas eagle guards his heritage 
over the city which long suffering 
endured and frenchmen slain on frenchmen rolled 
the green paws once again protection fling 
the mastiffs of verrucchio young and old 
who to montagna brought such evil cheer 
still clinch their fangs where they were wont to hold 
cities lamone and santerno near 
the lion couched in white are governed by 
which changes party with the changing year 
and that to which the savio wanders nigh 
as it is set twixt mountain and champaign 
lives now in freedom now neath tyranny 
but who thou art i to be told am fain 
be not more stubborn than we others found 
as thou on earth illustrious wouldst remain 
when first the fire a little while had moaned 
after its manner next the pointed crest 
waved to and fro then in this sense breathed sound 
if i believed my answer were addressed 
to one that earthward shall his course retrace 
this flame should forthwith altogether rest 
but since none ever yet out of this place 
returned alive if all be true i hear 
i yield thee answer fearless of disgrace 
i was a warrior then a cordelier 
thinking thus girt to purge away my stain 
and sure my hope had met with answer clear 
had not the high priestill with him remain 
plunged me anew into my former sin 
and why and how i would to thee make plain 
while i the frame of bones and flesh was in 
my mother gave me all the deeds i wrought 
were foxlike and in no wise leonine 
of every wile and hidden way i caught 
the secret trick and used them with such sleight 
that all the world with fame of it was fraught 
when i perceived i had attainèd quite 
the time of life when it behoves each one 
to furl his sails and coil his cordage tight 
sorrowing for deeds i had with pleasure done 
contrite and shriven i religious grew 
ah wretched me and well it was begun 
but for the chieftain of the pharisees new 
then waging war hard by the lateran 
and not with saracen nor yet with jew 
for christian were his enemies every man 
and none had at the siege of acre been 
or trafficked in the empire of soldàn 
his lofty office he held cheap and een 
his sacred orders and the cord i wore 
which used to make the wearers of it lean 
as from soracte constantine of yore 
sylvester called to cure his leprosy 
i as a leech was called this man before 
to cure him of his fever which ran high 
my counsel he required but i stood dumb 
for drunken all his words appeared to be 
he said for fear be in thy heart no room 
beforehand i absolve thee but declare 
how palestrina i may overcome 
heaven i unlock as thou art well aware 
and close at will because the keys are twin 
my predecessor was averse to bear 
then did his weighty reasoning on me win 
till to be silent seemed the worst of all 
and father i replied since from this sin 
thou dost absolve me into which i fall 
the scant performance of a promise wide 
will yield thee triumph in thy lofty stall 
francis came for me soon as eer i died 
but one of the black cherubim was there 
and take him not nor rob me of him cried 
for him of right among my thralls i bear 
because he offered counsel fraudulent 
since when ive had him firmly by the hair 
none is absolved unless he first repent 
nor can repentance house with purpose ill 
for this the contradiction doth prevent 
ah wretched me how did i shrinking thrill 
when clutching me he sneered perhaps of old 
thou didst not think i had in logic skill 
he carried me to minos minos rolled 
his tail eight times round his hard back in ire 
biting it fiercely ere of me he told 
among the sinners of the shrouding fire 
therefore am i where thou beholdest lost 
and sore at heart go clothed in such attire 
what he would say thus ended by the ghost 
away from us the moaning flame did glide 
while to and fro its pointed horn was tossed 
but we passed further on i and my guide 
along the cliff to where the arch is set 
oer the next moat where paying they reside 
as schismatics who whelmed themselves in debt 


canto xxviii 


could any even in words unclogged by rhyme 
recount the wounds that now i saw and blood 
although he aimed at it time after time 
here every tongue must fail of what it would 
because our human speech and powers of thought 
to grasp so much come short in aptitude 
if all the people were together brought 
who in apulia land distressed by fate 
made lamentation for the bloodshed wrought 
by rome and in that war procrastinate 
when the large booty of the rings was won 
as livy writes whose every word has weight 
with those on whom such direful deeds were done 
when robert guiscard they as foes assailed 
and those of whom still turns up many a bone 
at ceperan where each apulian failed 
in faith and those at tagliacozzo strewed 
where old alardo not by arms prevailed 
and each his wounds and mutilations showed 
yet would they far behind by those be left 
who had the vile ninth bolgia for abode 
no cask of middle stave or end bereft 
eer gaped like one i saw the rest among 
slit from the chin all downward to the cleft 
between his legs his entrails drooping hung 
the pluck and that foul bag were evident 
which changes what is swallowed into dung 
and while i gazed upon him all intent 
opening his breast his eyes on me he set 
saying behold how by myself im rent 
see how dismembered now is mahomet 
ali in front of me goes weeping too 
with visage from the chin to forelock split 
by all the others whom thou seest there grew 
scandal and schism while yet they breathed the day 
because of which they now are cloven through 
there stands behind a devil on the way 
us with his sword thus cruelly to trim 
he cleaves again each of our company 
as soon as we complete the circuit grim 
because the wounds of each are healed outright 
or eer anew he goes in front of him 
but who art thou that peerest from the height 
it may be putting off to reach the pain 
which shall the crimes confessed by thee requite 
death has not seized him yet nor is he taen 
to torment for his sins my master said 
but that he may a full experience gain 
by me a ghost tis doomed he should be led 
down the infernal circles round on round 
and what i tell thee is the truth indeed 
a hundred shades and more to whom the sound 
had reached stood in the moat to mark me well 
their pangs forgot so did the words astound 
let fra dolcin provide thou mayst him tell 
thou who perchance ere long shalt sunward go 
unless he soon would join me in this hell 
much food lest aided by the siege of snow 
the novarese should oer him victory get 
which otherwise to win they would be slow 
while this was said to me by mahomet 
one foot he held uplifted to the ground 
he let it fall and so he forward set 
next one whose throat was gaping with a wound 
whose nose up to the brows away was sheared 
and on whose head a single ear was found 
at me with all the others wondering peered 
and ere the rest an open windpipe made 
the outside of it all with crimson smeared 
o thou not here because of guilt he said 
and whom i sure on latian ground did know 
unless by strong similitude betrayed 
upon pier da medicin bestow 
a thought shouldst thou revisit the sweet plain 
that from vercelli slopes to marcabò 
and make thou known to fanos worthiest twain 
to messer guido and to angiolel 
they unless foresight here be wholly vain 
thrown overboard in gyve and manacle 
shall drown fast by cattolica as planned 
by treachery of a tyrant fierce and fell 
between majolica and cyprus strand 
a blacker crime did neptune never spy 
by pirates wrought or even by argives hand 
the traitor who is blinded of an eye 
lord of the town which of my comrades one 
had been far happier neer to have come nigh 
to parley with him will allure them on 
then so provide against focaras blast 
no need for them of vow or orison 
and i point out and tell if wish thou hast 
to get news of thee to the world conveyed 
who rues that eer his eyes thereon were cast 
on a companions jaw his hand he laid 
and shouted while the mouth he open prised 
tis this one here by whom no word is said 
he quenched all doubt in cæsar and advised 
himself an outlawthat a man equipped 
for strife ran danger if he temporised 
alas to look on how downcast and hipped 
curio once bold in counsel now appeared 
with gorge whence by the roots the tongue was ripped 
another one whose hands away were sheared 
in the dim air his stumps uplifted high 
so that his visage was with blood besmeared 
and mosca too remember loud did cry 
who said ah me a thing once done is done 
an evil seed for all in tuscany 
i added yea and death to every one 
of thine whence he woe piled on woe his way 
went like a man with grief demented grown 
but i to watch the gang made longer stay 
and something saw which i should have a fear 
without more proof so much as even to say 
but that my conscience bids me have good cheer 
the comrade leal whose friendship fortifies 
a man beneath the mail of purpose clear 
i saw in sooth still seems it fore mine eyes 
a headless trunk with that sad company 
it forward moved and on the selfsame wise 
the severed head clutched by the hair swung free 
down from the fist yea lanternlike hung down 
staring at us it murmured wretched me 
a lamp he made of headpiece once his own 
and he was two in one and one in two 
but how to him who thus ordains is known 
arrived beneath the bridge and full in view 
with outstretched arm his head he lifted high 
to bring his words well to us these i knew 
consider well my grievous penalty 
thou who though still alive art visiting 
the people dead what pain with this can vie 
in order that to earth thou news mayst bring 
of me that im bertrand de born know well 
who gave bad counsel to the younger king 
i son and sire made each gainst each rebel 
david and absalom were fooled not more 
by counsels of the false ahithophel 
kinsmen so close since i asunder tore 
severed alas i carry now my brain 
from what it grew from in this trunk of yore 
and so i prove the law of pain for pain 


canto xxix 


the many folk and wounds of divers kind 
had flushed mine eyes and set them on the flow 
till i to weep and linger had a mind 
but virgil said to me why gazing so 
why still thy vision fastening on the crew 
of dismal shades dismembered there below 
thou didst not thus the other bolgias view 
think if to count them be thine enterprise 
the valley circles twenty miles and two 
beneath our feet the moon already lies 
the time wears fast away to us decreed 
and greater things than these await thine eyes 
i answered swift hadst thou but given heed 
to why it was my looks were downward bent 
to yet more stay thou mightest have agreed 
my guide meanwhile was moving and i went 
behind him and continued to reply 
adding within the moat on which intent 
i now was gazing with such eager eye 
i trow a spirit weeps one of my kin 
the crime whose guilt is rated there so high 
then said the master henceforth hold thou in 
thy thoughts from wandering to him new things claim 
attention now so leave him with his sin 
him saw i at thee from the bridgefoot aim 
a threatening finger while he made thee known 
geri del bello heard i named his name 
but at the time thou wast with him alone 
engrossed who once held hautefort nor the place 
didst look at where he was so passed he on 
o leader mine death violent and base 
and not avenged as yet i made reply 
by any of his partners in disgrace 
made him disdainful therefore went he by 
and spake not with me if i judge aright 
which does the more my ruth intensify 
so we conversed till from the cliff we might 
of the next valley have had prospect good 
down to the bottom with but clearer light 
when we above the inmost cloister stood 
of malebolge and discerned the crew 
of such as there compose the brotherhood 
so many lamentations pierced me through 
and barbed with pity all the shafts were sped 
my open palms across my ears i drew 
from valdichianas every spital bed 
all ailments to september from july 
with all in maremma and sardinia bred 
heaped in one pit a sickness might supply 
like what was here and from it rose a stink 
like that which comes from limbs that putrefy 
then we descended by the utmost brink 
of the long ridgeleftward once more we fell 
until my vision quickened now could sink 
deeper to where justice infallible 
the minister of the almighty lord 
chastises forgers doomed on earth to hell 
ægina could no sadder sight afford 
as i believe when all the people ailed 
and all the air was so with sickness stored 
down to the very worms creation failed 
and died whereon the pristine folk once more 
as by the poets is for certain held 
from seed of ants their family did restore 
than what was offered by that valley black 
with plaguestruck spirits heaped upon the floor 
supine some lay each on the others back 
or stomach and some crawled with crouching gait 
for change of place along the doleful track 
speechless we moved with step deliberate 
with eyes and ears on those disease crushed down 
nor left them power to lift their bodies straight 
i saw two sit shoulder to shoulder thrown 
as plate holds plate up to be warmed from head 
down to the feet with scurf and scab oergrown 
nor ever saw i currycomb so plied 
by varlet with his master standing by 
or by one kept unwillingly from bed 
as i saw each of these his scratchers ply 
upon himself for nought else now avails 
against the itch which plagues them furiously 
the scab they tore and loosened with their nails 
as with a knife men use the bream to strip 
or any other fish with larger scales 
thou that thy mail dost with thy fingers rip 
my guide to one of them began to say 
and sometimes dost with them as pincers nip 
tell is there any here from italy 
among you all so may thy nails suffice 
for this their work to all eternity 
latians are both of us in this disguise 
of wretchedness weeping said one of those 
but who art thou demanding on this wise 
my guide made answer i am one who goes 
down with this living man from steep to steep 
that i to him inferno may disclose 
then broke their mutual prop trembling with deep 
amazement each turned to me with the rest 
to whom his words had echoed in the heap 
me the good master cordially addressed 
whateer thou hast a mind to ask them say 
and since he wished it thus i made request 
so may remembrance of you not decay 
within the upper world out of the mind 
of men but flourish still for many a day 
as ye shall tell your names and what your kind 
let not your vile disgusting punishment 
to full confession make you disinclined 
an aretine i to the stake was sent 
by albert of siena one confessed 
but came not here through that for which i went 
to death tis true i told him all in jest 
i through the air could float in upward gyre 
and he inquisitive and dull at best 
did full instruction in the art require 
i could not make him dædalus so then 
his second father sent me to the fire 
but to the deepest bolgia of the ten 
for alchemy which in the world i wrought 
the unerring minos doomed me now were men 
eer found i of the poet asked so fraught 
with vanity as are the sienese 
french vanity to theirs is surely nought 
the other leper hearing me to these 
my words omit the stricca swift did shout 
who knew his tastes with temperance to please 
and nicholas who earliest found out 
the lavish custom of the clovestuffed roast 
within the garden where such seed doth sprout 
nor count the club where caccia d ascian lost 
vineyards and woods mid whom away did throw 
his wit the abbagliato but whose ghost 
it is that thou mayst weet that backs thee so 
against the sienese make sharp thine eyes 
that thou my countenance mayst surely know 
in me capocchios shade thoult recognise 
who forged false coin by means of alchemy 
thou must remember if i well surmise 
how i of nature very ape could be 


canto xxx 


because of semele when junos ire 
was fierce gainst all that were to thebes allied 
as had been proved by many an instance dire 
so mad grew athamas that when he spied 
his wife as she with children twain drew near 
each hand by one encumbered loud he cried 
be now the nets outspread that i may snare 
cubs with the lioness at yon strait ground 
and stretching claws of all compassion bare 
he on learchus seized and swung him round 
and shattered him upon a flinty stone 
then she herself and the other burden drowned 
and when by fortune was all overthrown 
the trojans pride inordinate before 
monarch and kingdom equally undone 
hecuba sad and captive mourning oer 
polyxena when dolorous she beheld 
the body of her darling polydore 
upon the coast out of her wits she yelled 
and spent herself in barking like a hound 
so by her sorrow was her reason quelled 
but never yet was trojan fury found 
nor that of thebes to sting so cruelly 
brute beasts far less the human form to wound 
as two pale naked shades were stung whom i 
saw biting run like swine when they escape 
famished and eager from the empty sty 
capocchio coming up to in his nape 
one fixed his fangs and hauling at him made 
his belly on the stony pavement scrape 
the aretine who stood still trembling said 
that imp is gianni schicchi and he goes 
rabid thus trimming others o i prayed 
so may the teeth of the other one of those 
not meet in thee as ere she pass from sight 
thou freely shalt the name of her disclose 
and he to me that is the ancient sprite 
of shameless myrrha who let liking rise 
for him who got her past all bounds of right 
as to transgress with him she in disguise 
came near to him deception to maintain 
so he departing yonder from our eyes 
that he the lady of the herd might gain 
bequeathed his goods by formal testament 
while he buoso donates form did feign 
and when the rabid couple from us went 
who all this time by me were being eyed 
upon the rest illstarred i grew intent 
and fashioned like a lute i one espied 
had he been only severed at the place 
where at the groin mens lower limbs divide 
the grievous dropsy swoln with humours base 
which every part of true proportion strips 
till paunch grows out of keeping with the face 
compelled him widely ope to hold his lips 
like one in fever who by thirst possessed 
has one drawn up while the other chinward slips 
o ye who by no punishment distressed 
nor know i why are in this world of dool 
he said a while let your attention rest 
on master adam here of misery full 
living i all i wished enjoyed at will 
now lust i for a drop of water cool 
the waterbrooks that down each grassy hill 
of casentino to the arno fall 
and with cool moisture all their courses fill 
always and not in vain i see them all 
because the vision of them dries me more 
than the disease neath which my face grows small 
for rigid justice me chastising sore 
can in the place i sinned at motive find 
to swell the sighs in which i now deplore 
there lies romena where of the money coined 
with the baptists image i made counterfeit 
and therefore left my body burnt behind 
but could i see here guidos wretched sprite 
or alexanders or their brothers i 
for fonte branda would not give the sight 
one is already here unless they lie 
mad souls with power to wander through the crowd 
what boots it me whose limbs diseases tie 
but were i yet so nimble that i could 
creep one poor inch a century some while 
ago had i begun to take the road 
searching for him among this people vile 
and that although eleven miles tis long 
and has a width of more than half a mile 
because of them am i in such a throng 
for to forge florins i by them was led 
which by three carats of alloy were wrong 
who are the wretches twain i to him said 
who smoke like hand in wintertime fresh brought 
from water on thy right together spread 
here found i them nor have they budged a jot 
he said since i was hurled into this vale 
and as i deem eternally theyll not 
one with false charges joseph did assail 
false sinon greek from troy is the other wight 
burning with fever they this stink exhale 
then one of them perchance oercome with spite 
because he thus contemptuously was named 
smote with his fist upon the belly tight 
it sounded like a drum and then was aimed 
a blow by master adam at his face 
with arm no whit less hard while he exclaimed 
what though i can no longer shift my place 
because my members by disease are weighed 
i have an arm still free for such a case 
to which was answered when thou wast conveyed 
unto the fire twas not thus good at need 
but even more so when the coiners trade 
was plied by thee the swoln one true indeed 
but thou didst not bear witness half so true 
when trojans at thee for the truth did plead 
if i spake falsely thou didst oft renew 
false coin said sinon one fault brought me here 
thee more than any devil of the crew 
bethink thee of the horse thou perjurer 
he of the swoln paunch answered and that by 
all men tis known should anguish in thee stir 
be thirst that cracks thy tongue thy penalty 
and putrid water so the greek replied 
which fore thine eyes thy stomach moundeth high 
the coiner then thy mouth thou openest wide 
as thou art used thy slanderous words to vent 
but if i thirst and humours plump my hide 
thy head throbs with the fire within thee pent 
to lap narcissus mirror to implore 
and urge thee on would need no argument 
while i to hear them did attentive pore 
my master said thy fill of staring take 
to rouse my anger needs but little more 
and when i heard that he in anger spake 
toward him i turned with such a shame inspired 
recalled it seems afresh on me to break 
and as the man who dreams of hurt is fired 
with wish that he might know his dream a dream 
and so what is as twere not is desired 
so i struck dumb and filled with an extreme 
craving to find excuse unwittingly 
the meanwhile made the apology supreme 
less shame my master said would nullify 
a greater fault for greater guilt atone 
all sadness for it therefore lay thou by 
but bear in mind that thou art not alone 
if fortune hap again to bring thee near 
where people such debate are carrying on 
to things like these tis shame to lend an ear 




canto xxxi 


the very tongue that first had caused me pain 
biting till both my cheeks were crimsoned oer 
with healing medicine me restored again 
so have i heard the lance achilles bore 
which earlier was his fathers first would wound 
and then to health the wounded part restore 
from that sad valley we our backs turned round 
up the encircling rampart making way 
nor uttering as we crossed it any sound 
here was it less than night and less than day 
and scarce i saw at all what lay ahead 
but of a trumpet the sonorous bray 
no thunderpeal were heard beside itled 
mine eyes along the line by which it passed 
till on one spot their gaze concentrated 
when by the dolorous rout was overcast 
the sacred enterprise of charlemagne 
roland blew not so terrible a blast 
short time my head was that way turned when plain 
i many lofty towers appeared to see 
master what town is this i asked since fain 
thou art he said to pierce the obscurity 
while yet through distance tis inscrutable 
thou must of error needs the victim be 
arriving there thou shalt distinguish well 
how much by distance was thy sense betrayed 
therefore to swifter course thyself compel 
then tenderly he took my hand and said 
ere we pass further i would have thee know 
that at the fact thou mayst be less dismayed 
these are not towers but giants in a row 
set round the brink each in the pit abides 
his navel hidden and the parts below 
and even as when the veil of mist divides 
little by little dawns upon the sight 
what the obscuring vapour earlier hides 
so piercing the gross air uncheered by light 
as i step after step drew near the bound 
my error fled but i was filled with fright 
as montereggion with towers is crowned 
which from the walls encircling it arise 
so rising from the pits encircling mound 
half of their bodies towered before mine eyes 
dread giants still by jupiter defied 
from heaven wheneer it thunders in the skies 
the face of one already i descried 
his shoulders breast and down his belly far 
and both his arms dependent by his side 
when nature ceased such creatures as these are 
to form she of a surety wisely wrought 
wresting from mars such ministers of war 
and though she rue not that to life she brought 
the whale and elephant who deep shall read 
will justify her wisdom in his thought 
for when the powers of intellect are wed 
to strength and evil will with them made one 
the race of man is helpless left indeed 
as large and long as is st peters cone 
at rome the face appeared of every limb 
on scale like this was fashioned every bone 
so that the bank which covered half of him 
as might a tunic left uncovered yet 
so much that if to his hair they sought to climb 
three frisians end on end their match had met 
for thirty great palms i of him could see 
counting from where a mans cloakclasp is set 
rafel mai amech zabi almi 
out of the bestial mouth began to roll 
which scarce would suit more dulcet psalmody 
and then my leader charged him stupid soul 
stick to thy horn with it relieve thy mind 
when rage or other passions pass control 
feel at thy neck round which the thong is twined 
o puzzleheaded wretch from which tis slung 
clipping thy monstrous breast thou shalt it find 
and then to me from his own mouth is wrung 
proof of his guilt tis nimrod whose insane 
whim hindered men from speaking in one tongue 
leave we him here nor spend our speech in vain 
for words to him in any language said 
as unto others his no sense contain 
turned to the left we on our journey sped 
and at the distance of an arrows flight 
we found another huger and more dread 
by what artificer thus pinioned tight 
i cannot tell but his left arm was bound 
in front as at his back was bound the right 
by a chain which girt him firmly round and round 
about what of his frame there was displayed 
below the neck in fivefold gyre twas wound 
incited by ambition this one made 
trial of prowess gainst almighty jove 
my leader told and he is thus repaid 
tis ephialtes mightily who strove 
what time the giants to the gods caused fright 
the arms he wielded then no more will move 
and i to him fain would i if i might 
on the enormous briareus set eye 
and know the truth by holding him in sight 
antæus thou shalt see he made reply 
ere long and he can speak nor is in chains 
us to the depth of all iniquity 
he shall let down the one thoudst see remains 
far off like this one bound and like in make 
but in his face far more of fierceness reigns 
never when earth most terribly did quake 
shook any tower so much as what all oer 
and suddenly did ephialtes shake 
terror of death possessed me more and more 
the fear alone had served my turn indeed 
but that i marked the ligatures he wore 
then did we somewhat further on proceed 
reaching antæus who for good five ell 
his head not counted from the pit was freed 
o thou who from the fortunehaunted dell 
where scipio of glory was made heir 
when with his host to flight turned hannibal 
a thousand lions didst for booty bear 
away and who hadst thou but joined the host 
and like thy brethren fought some even aver 
the victory to earths sons had not been lost 
lower us now nor disobliging show 
to where cocytus fettered is by frost 
to tityus nor to typhon make us go 
to grant what here is longed for he hath power 
cease them to curl thy snout but bend thee low 
he can for wage thy name on earth restore 
he lives and still expecteth to live long 
if grace recall him not before his hour 
so spake my master then his hands he swung 
downward and seized my leader in all haste 
hands in whose grip even hercules once was wrung 
and virgil when he felt them round him cast 
said that i may embrace thee hither tend 
and in one bundle with him made me fast 
and as to him that under carisend 
stands on the side it leans to while clouds fly 
counter its slope the tower appears to bend 
even so to me who stood attentive by 
antæus seemed to stoop and i dismayed 
had gladly sought another road to try 
but us in the abyss he gently laid 
where lucifer and judas gulfed remain 
nor to it thus bent downward long time stayed 
but like a ships mast raised himself again 



canto xxxii 


had i sonorous rough rhymes at command 
such as would suit the cavern terrible 
rooted on which all the other ramparts stand 
the sap of fancies which within me swell 
closer id press but since i have not these 
with some misgiving i go on to tell 
for tis no task to play with as you please 
of all the world the bottom to portray 
nor one that with a baby speech agrees 
but let those ladies help me with my lay 
who helped amphion walls round thebes to pile 
and faithful to the facts my words shall stay 
o bove all creatures wretched for whose vile 
abode tis hard to find a language fit 
as sheep or goats ye had been happier while 
we still were standing in the murky pit 
beneath the giants feet set far below 
and at the high wall i was staring yet 
when this i heard heed to thy steps bestow 
lest haply by thy soles the heads be spurned 
of wretched brothers wearied in their woe 
before me as on hearing this i turned 
beneath my feet a frozen lake its guise 
rather of glass than water i discerned 
in all its course on austrian danube lies 
no veil in time of winter near so thick 
nor on the don beneath its frigid skies 
as this was here on which if tabernicch 
or mount pietrapana should alight 
not even the edge would answer with a creak 
and as the croaking frog holds well in sight 
its muzzle from the pool what time of year 
the peasant girl of gleaning dreams at night 
the mourning shades in ice were covered here 
seen livid up to where we blush with shame 
in storklike music their teeth chattering were 
with downcast face stood every one of them 
to cold from every mouth and to despair 
from every eye an ample witness came 
and having somewhat gazed around me there 
i to my feet looked down and saw two pressed 
so close together tangled was their hair 
say who are you with breast thus strained to breast 
i asked whereon their necks they backward bent 
and when their upturned faces lay at rest 
their eyes which earlier were but moistened sent 
tears oer their eyelids these the frost congealed 
and fettered fast before they further went 
plank set to plank no rivet ever held 
more firmly wherefore goatlike either ghost 
butted the other so their wrath prevailed 
and one who wanted both ears which the frost 
had bitten off with face still downward thrown 
asked why with us art thou so long engrossed 
if who that couple are thoudst have made known 
the vale down which bisenzios floods decline 
was once their father alberts and their own 
one body bore them search the whole malign 
caïna and thou shalt not any see 
more worthy to be fixed in gelatine 
not he whose breast and shadow equally 
were by one thrust of arthurs lance pierced through 
nor yet focaccia nor the one that me 
with his head hampers blocking out my view 
whose name was sassol mascheroni well 
thou must him know if thou art tuscan too 
and that thou needst not make me further tell 
im camicion de pazzi and carlin 
i weary for whose guilt shall mine excel 
a thousand faces saw i doglike grin 
frostbound whence i as now shall always shake 
whenever sight of frozen pools i win 
while to the centre we our way did make 
to which all things converging gravitate 
and me that chill eternal caused to quake 
whether by fortune providence or fate 
i know not but as mong the heads i went 
i kicked one full in the face who therefore straight 
why trample on me snarled and made lament 
unless thou comst to heap the vengeance high 
for montaperti why so virulent 
gainst me i said await me here till i 
by him o master shall be cleared of doubt 
then let my pace thy will be guided by 
my guide delayed and i to him spake out 
while he continued uttering curses shrill 
say what art thou at others thus to shout 
but who art thou that goest at thy will 
through antenora trampling on the face 
of others twere too much if thou wert still 
in life i live and it may help thy case 
was my reply if thou renown wouldst gain 
should i thy name upon my tablets place 
and he i for the opposite am fain 
depart thou hence nor work me further dool 
within this swamp thou flatterest all in vain 
then i began him by the scalp to pull 
and thou must tell how thou art called i said 
or soon thy hair will not be plentiful 
and he though every hair thou from me shred 
i will not tell thee nor my face turn round 
no though a thousand times thou spurn my head 
his locks ere this about my fist were wound 
and many a tuft i tore while doglike wails 
burst from him and his eyes still sought the ground 
then called another bocca what now ails 
ist not enough thy teeth go chattering there 
but thou must bark what devil thee assails 
ah now said i thou needst not aught declare 
accursed traitor and true news of thee 
to thy disgrace i to the world will bear 
begone tell what thou wilt he answered me 
but if thou issue hence not silent keep 
of him whose tongue but lately wagged so free 
he for the frenchmens money here doth weep 
him of duera saw i mayst thou tell 
where sinners shiver in the frozen deep 
shouldst thou be asked who else within it dwell 
thou hast the beccheria at thy side 
across whose neck the knife at florence fell 
john soldanieri may be yonder spied 
with ganellon and tribaldell who threw 
faenzas gates when slept the city wide 
him had we left our journey to pursue 
when frozen in a hole a pair i saw 
ones head like the others hat showed to the view 
and as their bread men hungerdriven gnaw 
the uppermost tore fiercely at his mate 
where nape and brainpan to a junction draw 
no worse by tydeus in his scornful hate 
were menalippus temples gnawed and hacked 
than skull and all were torn by him irate 
o thou who provest by such bestial act 
hatred of him who by thy teeth is chewed 
declare thy motive said i on this pact 
that if with reason thou with him hast feud 
knowing your names and manner of his crime 
i in the world to thee will make it good 
if what i speak with dry not ere the time 



canto xxxiii 


his mouth uplifting from the savage feast 
the sinner rubbed and wiped it free of gore 
on the hair of the head he from behind laid waste 
and then began thoudst have me wake once more 
a desperate grief of which to think alone 
ere i have spoken wrings me to the core 
but if my words shall be as seed that sown 
may fructify unto the traitors shame 
whom thus i gnaw i mingle speech and groan 
of how thou earnest hither or thy name 
i nothing know but that a florentine 
in very sooth thou art thy words proclaim 
thou then must know i was count ugolin 
the archbishop roger he now hearken well 
why i prove such a neighbour how in fine 
and flowing from his ill designs it fell 
that i confiding in his words was caught 
then done to death were waste of time to tell 
but that of which as yet thou heardest nought 
is how the death was cruel which i met 
hearken and judge if wrong to me he wrought 
scant window in the mew whose epithet 
of famine came from me its resident 
and cooped in which shall many languish yet 
had shown me through its slit how there were spent 
full many moons ere that bad dream i dreamed 
when of my future was the curtain rent 
lord of the hunt and master this one seemed 
chasing the wolf and wolfcubs on the height 
by which from pisan eyes is lucca hemmed 
with famished hounds well trained and swift of flight 
lanfranchi and gualandi in the van 
and sismond he had set within my sight 
both sire and sonsnor long the chasebegan 
to grow so seemed it weary as they fled 
then through their flanks fangs sharp and eager ran 
when i awoke before the morning spread 
i heard my sons all weeping in their sleep 
for they were with meand they asked for bread 
ah cruel if thou canst from pity keep 
at the bare thought of what my heart foreknew 
and if thou weepst not what could make thee weep 
now were they wake and near the moment drew 
at which twas used to bring us our repast 
but each was fearful lest his dream came true 
and then i heard the under gate made fast 
of the horrible tower and thereupon i gazed 
in my sons faces silent and aghast 
i did not weep for i to stone was dazed 
they wept and darling anselm me besought 
what ails thee father wherefore thus amazed 
and yet i did not weep and answered not 
the whole day and that night made answer none 
till on the world another sun shone out 
soon as a feeble ray of light had won 
into our doleful prison made aware 
of the four faces featured like my own 
both of my hands i bit at in despair 
and they imagining that i was fain 
to eat arose before me with the prayer 
o father twere for us an easier pain 
if thou wouldst eat us thou didst us array 
in this poor flesh unclothe us now again 
i calmed me not to swell their woe that day 
and the next day no single word we said 
ah pitiless earth that didst unyawning stay 
when we had reached the fourth day gaddo spread 
out at my feet fell prone and made demand 
why o my father offering us no aid 
there died he plain as i before thee stand 
i saw the three as one by one they failed 
the fifth day and the sixth then with my hand 
blind now i groped for each of them and wailed 
on them for two days after they were gone 
famine at last more strong than grief prevailed 
when he had uttered this his eyes all thrown 
awry upon the hapless skull he fell 
with teeth that doglike rasped upon the bone 
ah pisa byword of the folk that dwell 
in the sweet country where the si doth sound 
since slow thy neighbours to reward thee well 
let now gorgona and capraia mound 
themselves where arno with the sea is blent 
till every one within thy walls be drowned 
for though report of ugolino went 
that he betrayed thy castles thou didst wrong 
thus cruelly his children to torment 
these were not guilty for they were but young 
thou modern thebes brigata and young hugh 
and the other twain of whom above tis sung 
we onward passed to where another crew 
of shades the thickribbed ice doth fettered keep 
their heads not downward these but backward threw 
their very weeping will not let them weep 
and grief encountering barriers at their eyes 
swells flowing inward their affliction deep 
for the first tears that issue crystallise 
and fill like vizor fashioned out of glass 
the hollow cup oer which the eyebrows rise 
and though as twere a callus now my face 
by reason of the frost was wholly grown 
benumbed and dead to feeling i could trace 
so it appeared a breeze against it blown 
and asked o master whence comes this so low 
as where we are is any vapour known 
and he replied thou ere long while shalt go 
where touching this thine eye shall answer true 
discovering that which makes the wind to blow 
then from the cold crust one of that sad crew 
demanded loud spirits for whom they hold 
the inmost room so truculent were you 
back from my face let these hard veils be rolled 
that i may vent the woe which chokes my heart 
ere tears again solidify with cold 
and i to him first tell me who thou art 
if thoudst have help then if i help not quick 
to the bottom of the ice let me depart 
he answered i am friar alberic 
he of the fruit grown in the orchard fell 
and here am i repaid with date for fig 
ah said i to him art thou dead as well 
how now my body fares he answered me 
up in the world i have no skill to tell 
for ptolomæa has this quality 
the soul oft plunges hither to its place 
ere it has been by atropos set free 
and that more willingly from off my face 
thou mayst remove the glassy tears know soon 
as ever any soul of man betrays 
as i betrayed the body once his own 
a demon takes and governs until all 
the span allotted for his life be run 
into this tank headlong the soul doth fall 
and on the earth his body yet may show 
whose shade behind me wintry frosts enthral 
but thou canst tell if newly come below 
it is ser branca doria and complete 
is many a year since he was fettered so 
it seems i answered that thou wouldst me cheat 
for branca doria never can have died 
he sleeps puts clothes on swallows drink and meat 
or eer to the tenacious pitchy tide 
which boils in malebranches moat had come 
the shade of michael zanche he replied 
that soul had left a devil in its room 
within its body of his kinsmen one 
treacherous with him experienced equal doom 
but stretch thy hand and be its work begun 
of setting free mine eyes this did not i 
twas highest courtesy to yield him none 
ah genoese strange to morality 
ye men infected with all sorts of sin 
out of the world tis time that ye should die 
here to romagnas blackest soul akin 
i chanced on one of you for doing ill 
his soul oerwhelmed cocytus floods within 
though in the flesh he seems surviving still 



canto xxxiv 


vexilla regis prodeunt inferni 
towards where we are seek then with vision keen 
my master bade if trace of him thou spy 
as when the exhalations dense have been 
or when our hemisphere grows dark with night 
a windmill from afar is sometimes seen 
i seemed to catch of such a structure sight 
and then to scape the blast did backward draw 
behind my guidesole shelter in my plight 
now was i where i versify with awe 
the shades were wholly covered and did show 
visible as in glass are bits of straw 
some stood upright and some were lying low 
some with head topmost others with their feet 
and some with face to feet bent like a bow 
but we kept going on till it seemed meet 
unto my master that i should behold 
the creature once of countenance so sweet 
he stepped aside and stopped me as he told 
lo dis and lo we are arrived at last 
where thou must nerve thee and must make thee bold 
how i hereon stood shivering and aghast 
demand not reader this i cannot write 
so much the fact all reach of words surpassed 
i was not dead yet living was not quite 
think for thyself if gifted with the power 
what life and death denied me was my plight 
of that tormented realm the emperor 
out of the ice stood free to middle breast 
and me a giant less would overtower 
than would his arm a giant by such test 
judge then what bulk the whole of him must show 
of true proportion with such limb possessed 
if he was fair of old as hideous now 
and yet his brows against his maker raised 
meetly from him doth all affliction flow 
o how it made me horribly amazed 
when on his head i saw three faces grew 
the one vermilion which straight forward gazed 
and joining on to it were other two 
one rising up from either shoulderbone 
till to a junction on the crest they drew 
twixt white and yellow seemed the righthand one 
the left resembled them whose country lies 
where valleywards the floods of nile flow down 
beneath each face two mighty wings did rise 
such as this bird tremendous might demand 
sails of seaships neer saw i of such size 
not feathered were they but in style were planned 
like a bats wing by them a threefold breeze 
for still he flapped themevermore was fanned 
and through its depths cocytus caused to freeze 
down three chins tears for ever made descent 
from his six eyes and red foam mixed with these 
in every mouth there was a sinner rent 
by teeth that shred him as a heckle would 
thus three at once compelled he to lament 
to the one in front twas little to be chewed 
compared with being clawed and clawed again 
till his backbone of skin was sometimes nude 
the soul up yonder in the greater pain 
is judas scariot with his head among 
the teeth my master said while outward strain 
his legs of the two whose heads are downward hung 
brutus is from the black jowl pendulous 
see how he writhes yet never wags his tongue 
the other great of thew is cassius 
but night is rising and we must be gone 
for everything hath now been seen by us 
then as he bade i to his neck held on 
while he the time and place of vantage chose 
and when the wings enough were open thrown 
he grasped the shaggy ribs and clutched them close 
and so from tuft to tuft he downward went 
between the tangled hair and crust which froze 
we to the bulging haunch had made descent 
to where the hipjoint lies in it and then 
my guide with painful twist and violent 
turned round his head to where his feet had been 
and like a climber closely clutched the hair 
i thought to hell that we returned again 
hold fast to me it needs by such a stair 
panting my leader said like man foredone 
that we from all that wretchedness repair 
right through a hole in a rock when he had won 
the edge of it he gave me for a seat 
and deftly then to join me clambered on 
i raised mine eyes expecting they would meet 
with lucifer as i beheld him last 
but saw instead his upturned legs and feet 
if in perplexity i then was cast 
let ignorant people think who do not see 
what point it was that i had lately passed 
rise to thy feet my master said to me 
the way is long and rugged the ascent 
and at mid tierce the sun must almost be 
twas not as if on palace floors we went 
a dungeon fresh from natures hand was this 
rough underfoot and of light indigent 
or ever i escape from the abyss 
o master said i standing now upright 
correct in few words where i think amiss 
where lies the ice how hold we him in sight 
set upside down the sun how had it skill 
in so short while to pass to morn from night 
and he in fancy thou art standing still 
on yon side of the centre where i caught 
the vile worms hair which through the world doth drill 
there wast thou while our downward course i wrought 
but when i turned the centre was passed by 
which by all weights from every point is sought 
and now thou standest neath the other sky 
opposed to that which vaults the great dry ground 
and neath whose summit there did whilom die 
the man whose birth and life were sinless found 
thy feet are firm upon the little sphere 
on this side answering to judeccas round 
tis evening yonder when tis morning here 
and he whose tufts our ladder rungs supplied 
fixed as he was continues to appear 
headlong from heaven he fell upon this side 
whereon the land protuberant here before 
for fear of him did in the ocean hide 
and neath our sky emerged land as of yore 
still on this side perhaps that it might shun 
his fall heaved up and filled this depth no more 
from belzebub still widening up and on 
farstretching as the sepulchre extends 
a region not beheld but only known 
by murmur of a brook which through it wends 
declining by a channel eaten through 
the flinty rock and gently it descends 
my guide and i our journey to pursue 
to the bright world upon this road concealed 
made entrance and no thought of resting knew 
he first i second still ascending held 
our way until the fair celestial train 
was through an opening round to me revealed 
and issuing thence we saw the stars again
