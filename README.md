# Project CodeRead


### by Wanqian Yang


My final project for Harvard College's CS50. This is a web application designed to showcase the use of computational methods in text processing, in the field known as the digital humanities. Data visualization packages made use of include sigma.js and plotly. A basic recurrent neural network is adapted from [char-rnn by Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy).

This website has been deployed and can be viewed [here](projectcoderead.herokuapp.com).
