Project CodeRead


by Wanqian Yang


Comments on code only for the Python scripts and the HTML files with significant Javascript. Remaining files are CSS style files, as well as text files for various books analyzed. For the Javascript files, comments will only be for Genesis (i.e. "mapgenesis.html", "creategenesis.html" and "emotiongenesis.html"), since the files for the other texts are similar.
